"Identifying who has long COVID in the USA: a machine learning approach using N3C data

","Background: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as long COVID, have severely affected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for patients and society alike. Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has it-the latter is the aim of this study.
Methods: Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age ≥18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site.
Findings: Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0·92 (all patients), 0·90 (hospitalised), and 0·85 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record.

","To avoid influencing the model with previous assumptions about the features of long COVID, we took a light-touch approach to feature selection, performing as little manual curation of features as possible before training and testing our models. Because of this approach, the reasons that a given feature might be important to one or more of the models is not always obvious. However, review by clinical experts of the features shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and in the appendix (pp 7–9) revealed a number of possible themes.
First, post-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms and associated treatments. These features are commonly reported for patients with long COVID.7, 9, 22 A confounding factor that prioritises these features might be that the long COVID clinics at two of the three sites that contributed long COVID clinic patients are based in the pulmonary department. However, given that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus, it is not surprising that long-term respiratory symptoms were observed. Similar long-term respiratory symptomatology is well described with respiratory viral syndromes, including those from severe acute respiratory syndrome, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and COVID-19.23, 24 The high proportion of albuterol use and use of inhaled steroids is consistent with the expected high prevalence of post-viral reactive airways disease. Examples of the most important features include dyspnoea or difficulty breathing, cough, albuterol, guaifenesin, and hypoxaemia.
Second, non-respiratory symptoms widely reported as part of long COVID and associated treatments. Sleep disorders, anxiety, malaise, chest pain, and constipation have all been reported as symptoms of long COVID, and are included in WHO's case definition.10 The example features in this group include symptoms and mitigating treatments. Example features include dyssomnia, chest pain, and malaise, and treatments with lorazepam, melatonin, and polyethylene glycol 3350.
Third, pre-existing risk factors for greater acute COVID severity. Some known risk factors for acute COVID-19 and severity are associated with long COVID—including chronic conditions (such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic pulmonary disease), which predispose patients at increased risk for worsened COVID-19 symptoms.25
Fourth, proxies for hospitalisation. Features that are representative of standard hospital admission orders probably contributed to the model as proxies for hospitalisation in general, rather than being individually meaningful. These features were most prominent in patients without long COVID (true negatives), suggesting that the model is correctly differentiating between acute illness requiring hospitalisation and long COVID. Example features include the use of glucose, ketorolac, propofol, and naloxone.
Although there is considerable overlap between the most important features across the three models, there are also distinct differences (Figure 3, Figure 4; appendix pp 7–9). Notable differences include the high importance of dexamethasone in the hospitalised model, which decreased the likelihood of an individual patient being labelled as a potential long COVID patient. Dexamethasone is not present in the top 50 features of the non-hospitalised model. Similarly, cough and dyssomnia, which increased the likelihood of an individual beinglabelled as a potential long COVID patient, are important features in the non-hospitalised model, but do not appear in the hospitalised model. COVID-19 vaccination after acute disease, which is consistently an important feature in all three models, decreased the likelihood of patients being labelled as potentially having long COVID. This result is noteworthy and indicates that not only does vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 protect against hospitalisation and death, but that it might also protect against long COVID.
Rates of outpatient and inpatient utilisation are important features in all three models. This finding can be interpreted in a number of ways—patients who continue to feel unwell long after acute COVID-19 might be more likely to visit their providers repeatedly than those patients who fully recover. Because diagnosing and treating the heterogenous symptoms of long COVID is a challenge, these patients could be referred to one or more specialists, further increasing their utilisation.
Machine learning models do not consider each feature individually; rather, complex relationships between features can greatly influence classification. Each patient has their own path through the model, based on their available data, as shown in figure 5. Information of this type is useful to make the outcomes of the machine learning models interpretable.
Electronic health records were the source of all features used by our model. Although electronic health records contain rich clinical features, these data are also a proxy for health-care utilisation and can be interpreted through that lens. Diagnoses coded in the electronic health record are not representative of the whole patient, but rather are focused on the specific reasons the patient has visited a health-care site on that day. Moreover, the absence of electronic health record data about a patient does not equate to the absence of a disease; it merely represents the absence of a patient seeking care for that disease.
Even as a proxy for health-care utilisation, electronic health record data is well suited to the task of cohort definition by way of computable phenotyping, especially when the end goal is study recruitment. Although there are other methods of identifying potential study participants, a computable phenotype allows us to efficiently narrow the recruitment pool down from everyone available to patients who are likely to qualify— easily eliminating large numbers of patients that do not qualify, and ascertaining patients that might elude human curation.
There are additional advantages to using electronic health record data to identify patients with long COVID. With an evolving definition and no gold standard to compare with, the electronic health record allows us to define proxies for a condition and select on those—in this case, a patient's visit to a long COVID specialty clinic. However, rather than settling for a restrictive criterion of at least one visit to a long COVID specialty clinic, our machine learning models allow us to decouple patients' utilisation patterns from the clinic visit, meaning that we can use the models to identify similar patients who might not have access to a long COVID clinic.
This study has several limitations. Electronic health record data is skewed towards patients who make more use of health-care systems, and is further skewed towards high utilisers, patients with more severe symptoms, and hospital inpatients. When researchers train models on N3C's electronic health record data, it is essential to acknowledge whose data is less likely to be represented; for example, uninsured patients, patients with restricted access to or ability to pay for care, or patients seeking care at small practices or community hospitals with scarce data exchange capabilities. Moreover, for patients included in our models, clinic visits and hospitalisations that occur outside of the health-care system (ie, N3C site) for that patient are generally absent from our data. Finally, because our models require an index date for the execution of temporal logic, we cannot make use of cases without a positive indicator (test or diagnosis code) recorded in the electronic health record. This approach excludes the analysis of patients who had COVID-19 early in the pandemic and were not able to be tested.
We did not include race and ethnicity as model features, because we did not believe our three-site sample of long COVID clinic patients to be appropriately representative. As more data on patients with long COVID are available over time, we will be able to balance the cohort based on demographics and, critically, carefully account for race and ethnicity in future iterations of the model.
Because two of the three clinics that provided us with long COVID patient data are based in a pulmonary department, we acknowledge that our lists of important features prominently feature pulmonary conditions and treatments. Feature importance should not necessarily be interpreted as important to the diagnosis and characterisation of long COVID itself, but rather as important as inputs for an accurate electronic health record-based model. As we collect more training data from additional clinics over time, we suspect this set of features might change to provide a fuller picture of the condition. We recommend that readers wishing to utilise the model presented here consult our GitHub repository, where future iterations of the model will be made available.
Beyond identifying cohorts for research studies, the models presented here can be used in various applications and could be enhanced in several ways. Specifically, in future studies, it will be necessary to use a large sample size of patients with long COVID to validate hypotheses relating to social determinants of health and demographics, comorbidities, and treatment implications, and to understand the relationship between acute COVID-19 severity and specific long COVID signs and symptoms and their longitudinal progression. The influence of vaccination in such trajectories will also need to be explored.
It is plausible that long COVID will not have a single definition, and it might be better described as a set of related conditions with their own symptoms, trajectories, and treatments. Thus, as larger cohorts of patients with long COVID are established, future research should identify sub-phenotypes of long COVID by clustering patients with long COVID with similar electronic health record data fingerprints. Such fingerprints might be enhanced by natural language processing of clinical notes, which often include descriptions of signs and symptoms not recorded in structured diagnosis data. Future iterations of our models could discern among these clusters given N3C's large sample size and recurring data feeds.

"Distinguishing features of Long COVID identified through immune profiling
","Post-acute infection syndromes may develop after acute viral disease1. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in the development of a post-acute infection syndrome known as long COVID. Individuals with long COVID frequently report unremitting fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and a variety of cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions2–4. However, the biological processes that are associated with the development and persistence of these symptoms are unclear. Here 275 individuals with or without long COVID were enrolled in a cross-sectional study that included multidimensional immune phenotyping and unbiased machine learning methods to identify biological features associated with long COVID. Marked differences were noted in circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to the matched controls, as well as evidence of exaggerated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with long COVID. Furthermore, higher antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens were observed among individuals with long COVID, particularly Epstein–Barr virus. Levels of soluble immune mediators and hormones varied among groups, with cortisol levels being lower among participants with long COVID. Integration of immune phenotyping data into unbiased machine learning models identified the key features that are most strongly associated with long COVID status. Collectively, these findings may help to guide future studies into the pathobiology of long COVID and help with developing relevant biomarkers.","Studies of individuals with LC reported diverse changes in immune and inflammatory factors36,37. In this study, exploratory analyses identified significant immunological differences between individuals with LC and demographically matched control populations more than a year after their acute infections. Circulating immune cell populations were significantly changed. Populations of non-conventional monocytes, double-negative B cells and IL-4/IL-6-secreting CD4+ T cells increased, and those of conventional DC1 and central memory CD4+ T cells decreased. Moreover, individuals with LC had higher levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, EBV and VZV antigens. By contrast, the levels of individual autoantibodies to human exoproteome did not significantly differ. Marked differences in the levels of circulating cytokines and hormones, particularly cortisol, were noted in participants with LC from both the MY-LC and EXT-LC cohorts. Unbiased machine learning revealed several core predictive features of LC status within the MY-LC study, identifying potential targets for additional validation and future biomarker development.",,,
Machine learning identifies long COVID patterns from electronic health records,"A machine learning algorithm identifies four reproducible clinical subphenotypes of long COVID from the electronic health records of patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30–180 days of infection; these patterns have implications for the treatment and management of long COVID.
","We identified four reproducible clinical subphenotypes of long COVID in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with incident conditions within 30–180 days of infection, on the basis of their EHRs. We thus effectively ‘teased out’ patterns in the clinical heterogeneity of long COVID, which could potentially inform future research on the disease mechanisms of long COVID, treatment development and public health policymaking.
A limitation of our study is the use of EHRs, which record patients’ information from their clinical visits. Consequently, the data we analyzed do not contain information from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in these two clinical research networks who did not visit a clinic during the post-acute infection period, possibly owing to mild symptoms and signs, so we might have missed these patients. In addition, we analyzed the EHRs of patients who were infected with early SARS-CoV-2 variants, which meant that we did not assess the pattern of sequelae associated with the Omicron variant. Finally, our analysis is based on clinical observational data and thus cannot explain the disease pathophysiology of long COVID.
Our study provides evidence that the long COVID conditions do not appear independently but instead occur in patterns that correspond to reproducible subphenotypes. Follow-up studies are needed to further validate these subphenotypes in patient populations from other geographical areas in the United States and other countries. Data captured in more recent SARS-CoV-2 variant waves should also be analyzed to determine whether the subphenotype patterns have shifted. Basic science and translational researchers, clinical care professionals and public health policymakers should be aware of these long COVID clinical subphenotypes when making their action plans for managing the ongoing pandemic.

"The role of machine learning in health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and in long COVID management
","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the most challenging health crises in modern times. The development of effective strategies to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were major goals for governments and policy makers. Mathematical modeling and machine learning emerged as potent tools to guide and optimize the different control measures. This review briefly summarizes the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolution during the first 3 years. It details the main public health challenges focusing on the contribution of mathematical modeling to design and guide government action plans and spread mitigation interventions of SARS-CoV-2. Next describes the application of machine learning methods in a series of study cases, including COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, the analysis of epidemiological variables, and drug discovery by protein engineering techniques. Lastly, it explores the use of machine learning tools for investigating long COVID, by identifying patterns and relationships of symptoms, predicting risk indicators, and enabling early evaluation of COVID-19 sequelae.","Mathematical models have helped to understand the dynamics of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and helped to predict different scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming one of the most relevant tools for developing public health policies. Correlating sanitary measures with virus variants and the effects on the reproduction rate enabled the assessment of government policies that will help to face new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or future pandemics. The development of reliable mathematical models, statistical techniques for test correction, and methods of analysis of heterogeneous populations, together with the value of testing strategies and traceability of close contacts, has been remarkable achievements. Combining these systems with ML and AI methods increased the predictive power of the models and facilitated the simulation of scenarios.
Developing predictive systems for COVID-19 was one of the significant challenges assumed by thousands of scientists during the pandemic. The main achievements were developing models for clinical diagnostic systems, ML for drug and vaccine discovery, and forecasting models for epidemiological variables to support public health policies and monitoring systems. In turn, the development of predictive systems coupled with techniques such as protein language models and molecular techniques facilitated the study of variants at the genomic level. Such models helped to understand how mutations affected critical viral proteins, helping drug and vaccine designs.
The ongoing pandemic has introduced a complete set of challenges, and currently, a novel multisystem disease defined by the persistence or appearance of new symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged. This complex entity-denominated LC has yet to be fully elucidated, mainly because it is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, methodological limitations, and heterogeneous definitions that make clinical and computational analysis difficult. Despite rapidly emerging studies and growing evidence, current data needs to be improved. A primary task is to establish an approach to identify natural language data associated with potential LC patients. This task will likely require well-designed prospective studies, unified definitions of LC, an accurate distinction of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms, and adequate follow-up times that include current patients, underrepresented groups, children, and minority populations. It is granted that ML strategies will play a critical role in the understanding of LC and other upcoming challenges of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

"Comprehensively identifying Long Covid articles with human-in-the-loop machine learning
","A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long Covid Collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long Covid by any name, (2) when the condition is named, the name used most frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated with disorders in a wide variety of body systems.","COVID-19 has caused widespread mortality and has strained healthcare systems worldwide.46 Estimates of the overall morbidity burden show, however, that most of the burden lies in COVID-19 survivors.17 While estimates of the prevalence of Long Covid vary, a recent meta-analysis shows that the prevalence of symptoms beyond 4 weeks is quite high: 43%.26 Moreover, the effects experienced many years or decades later are yet unknown. Continuing research into Long Covid is critical, and identifying Long Covid articles comprehensively allows the articles to be analyzed as a set. Our analyses of both the entity mentions and the topic clustering support the view that Long Covid is a multisystemic condition. Notably, our experiments did not uncover support for psychological causes. However, both the analysis of entity mentions and the topic clustering find a greater number of symptoms associated with Long Covid than treatments for those symptoms. Moreover, analysis of the LitCovid topics (see Figure S1) shows that articles relevant for Long Covid are far more likely to be case reports than other articles on COVID-19, and the number of articles discussing mechanism has remained relatively stable over time, even as the diagnosis and treatment topics have expanded.
We also find that there is a significant overlap between the symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the symptoms associated with Long Covid. This supports the view that the name Long Covid is descriptive of the condition as extended COVID. The fact that the name Long Covid is both the most common name and an increasing number of articles use the name suggests that a consensus is building, albeit slowly. However, this does not preclude another name—or subtype name—gaining favor once the etiology—or etiologies—are identified. Interestingly, other names were initially used for both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, pneumonia of unknown etiology and 2019-nCoV, respectively, though a consensus built fairly quickly.40 Unlike COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, however, standardizing organizations have not argued for specific terminology for Long Covid; use of the term Long Covid is largely due to patient advocacy efforts.4
Our definition of Long Covid is primarily time-based, while many of the studies in the literature that discuss sequelae of COVID-19 are primarily concerned with a specific body system. This is particularly the case with neurological effects, which are prevalent in Long Covid but may also appear much earlier, even as the initial manifestation of infection. Our annotators noted that many articles could not be labeled from just the title and abstract; this is primarily because of the condition that symptoms must be present at least a month after initial infection. Moreover, our combination of a broad definition and short time frame (1 month post infection) implies the inclusion of some post-COVID conditions with an acute presentation, notably MIS-C and mucormycosis. However, these conditions do share some elements, such as immune system dysregulation. Nevertheless, Long Covid remains an area of active research and updates are expected.
Our work has several limitations. Our analyses are mostly correlational and do not show, for example, that the association between specific symptoms are definitively caused by Long Covid. Our method does not specifically address language drift, though the effects of language drift should be ameliorated somewhat through the iterative annotation process. We anticipate that the Long Covid Collection itself will remain relevant for some time even if a strong consensus builds and the level of terminological variation drops significantly. Again, Long Covid remains an area of active research, and new developments are expected.
Our methods are automated and do not produce perfect accuracy. However, this is partially due to inherent ambiguities. For example, it is sometimes difficult to label articles based on the title and abstract, such as determining whether a reference to COVID-19 patients refers to patients who had COVID-19 previously or patients who currently have acute COVID-19 (e.g., PMID: 35043098). Unfortunately, the full text is often not available.
It is difficult to provide a definitive discussion of how many articles must be annotated to provide high coverage. However, our framework already provides an AUC of approximately 0.70 using only the labeling functions that do not require training (data not shown). We performed a series of experiments iteratively rerunning article selection and found that 1,000 manually annotated articles reliably produces a model with an AUC of over 0.80 (data not shown). In this work we also intended to provide a reliable, comprehensive collection of articles on Long Covid; we therefore proceeded to manually annotate most of the relevant articles and a nearly equal number of irrelevant articles. Note, however, that this still results in a significant annotation savings compared with manual annotation: we annotated approximately 3.7% of the articles in LitCovid, representing an annotations savings of 96.3%. We therefore believe that our framework reduces the need for manual annotations when identifying high-variation terminology.

"Generalisable long COVID subtypes: Findings from the NIH N3C and RECOVER programmes
","Stratification of patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or long COVID) would allow precision clinical management strategies. However, long COVID is incompletely understood and characterised by a wide range of manifestations that are difficult to analyse computationally. Additionally, the generalisability of machine learning classification of COVID-19 clinical outcomes has rarely been tested.Stratification of patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or long COVID) would allow precision clinical management strategies. However, long COVID is incompletely understood and characterised by a wide range of manifestations that are difficult to analyse computationally. Additionally, the generalisability of machine learning classification of COVID-19 clinical outcomes has rarely been tested.","According to the WHO, approximately 10–20% of patients with COVID-19 may experience new-onset, lingering or recurrent clinical symptoms after acute infection. This has been termed ‘post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection’ (PASC) or long COVID. Definitions of long COVID in the literature vary, and the frequencies and time course of phenotypic manifestations following acute COVID-19 are highly heterogeneous.10 This observation raises the question of whether long COVID can be stratified into well delineated and reproducible subtypes, or whether the degree of heterogeneity is so high that stratification is impossible. This is critically relevant for defining sub-cohorts in clinical research studies such as the NIH program “Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER),” and for identifying candidate therapeutics. ML clustering methods offer a data-driven approach to stratification of patients that can reveal such subtypes in the face of this new and heterogeneous disease.
Evidence available prior to our study suggests that important clinical differences do exist that influence the susceptibility to subsequent complications of COVID-19. For instance, although males are more likely to be hospitalised or die with acute COVID-19, females are more likely to develop long COVID.43 It is possible that the pathophysiology of long COVID may be multifactorial in origin. Conceivably, the biological underpinnings of long COVID may vary among individuals as a function of baseline risk factors, resulting in different general phenotypes of long COVID, the treatment or prevention of which may need to be specifically tailored using precision medicine in order to achieve optimal outcomes. As a first step, we sought to use unsupervised learning to delineate potential subtypes of patients with long COVID with differing clinical characteristics. We identified six published studies that present clusters from either patient-reported data (in four studies) or manually recorded clinical data (two studies) with cohorts of between 145 and 3762 patients. The studies report two or three clusters based on different types of input data, making study comparison challenging. None of the studies were based on EHR data and no assessment of generalisability to other data partners was presented.9,46, 47, 48, 49, 50
Here we have presented a method for semantic clustering of long COVID patients based on HPO-encoded EHR data. We further present a method for assessing generalisability of the identified subtypes or clusters across different data contributing sites. Ontology-based algorithms differ from machine learning and other algorithms in many ways. Coding numerical data with HPO implies that parameters are simplified into categories. Although this loss of numerical data reduces precision in data granularity, simplification allows powerful simultaneous analysis of all phenotypic observations using semantic similarity that can take the relatedness of concepts into account.
Our method for assessing patient–patient similarity using the Phenomizer algorithm generates an essentially continuous similarity value from arbitrary sets of HPO terms that characterise any two patients. An alternative method would be to encode the 287 HPO terms as a 287-dimensional feature vector and to measure similarity for example using dot product (cosine) of these vectors. The Phenomizer algorithm has several advantages over the feature vector method: it does not suffer from sparse count issues that may make clustering less robust,51 and it takes advantage of the similarity between individual items using the structure of the HPO in a way that a feature vector cannot.22 This approach has proven powerful both in the support of differential diagnosis of rare disease and in efforts to enable longitudinal analysis of EHR data as a means of identifying gene–phenotype associations with Mendelian forms of epilepsy,52,53 but has never before been applied in the context of infectious disease EHR data and methods for assessing generalisability have not previously been presented.
We have shown that unsupervised learning based on semantic clustering identifies phenotypic profiles that are reproducible across data partners with a high degree of statistical significance. The six clusters that emerged demonstrated non-uniform frequencies of symptoms and clinical findings across an array of features, spanning constitutional/systemic symptoms and pain, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptom domains, with some degree of overlap but clear distinctions between various groups. We interpret our multisystem-lab cluster as comprising patients with a severe course of acute COVID-19 because of the higher hospitalisation rates (Table 1) and mortality (Table 3). It is possible that this cluster represents a subtype of long COVID that results from severe acute COVID-19. Our findings confirm and extend previous findings of a steeper risk gradient for long COVID manifestations that increases according to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection.54
We suggest that analogous algorithms could be used to evaluate data gathered from prospective studies of long COVID patients to extend and deepen our characterization of phenotypic clusters by including data that are currently difficult to ascertain reliably from EHR data, including symptoms such as Asthenia (HP:0025406) or Exertional dyspnea (HP:0002875) and radiology findings (which are typically not represented using structured fields in EHR data and are underrepresented in OMOP datasets). The recently released Phenopacket Schema of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) provides a standardised way to record clinical findings including phenotypic features, measurements, biospecimens, and medical actions over the time course of a disease as a computational case report.55 Recording clinical data with the Phenopacket Schema would promote data sharing and comparability of results from different studies.

"Elevated vascular transformation blood biomarkers in Long-COVID indicate angiogenesis as a key pathophysiological mechanism
","Background Long-COVID is characterized by prolonged, diffuse symptoms months after acute COVID-19. Accurate diagnosis and targeted therapies for Long-COVID are lacking. We investigated vascular transformation biomarkers in Long-COVID patients.

Methods A case–control study utilizing Long-COVID patients, one to six months (median 98.5 days) post-infection, with multiplex immunoassay measurement of sixteen blood biomarkers of vascular transformation, including ANG-1, P-SEL, MMP-1, VE-Cad, Syn-1, Endoglin, PECAM-1, VEGF-A, ICAM-1, VLA-4, E-SEL, thrombomodulin, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, VCAM-1 and VEGF-D.

Results Fourteen vasculature transformation blood biomarkers were significantly elevated in Long-COVID outpatients, versus acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy controls subjects (P < 0.05). A unique two biomarker profile consisting of ANG-1/P-SEL was developed with machine learning, providing a classification accuracy for Long-COVID status of 96%. Individually, ANG-1 and P-SEL had excellent sensitivity and specificity for Long-COVID status (AUC = 1.00, P < 0.0001; validated in a secondary cohort). Specific to Long-COVID, ANG-1 levels were associated with female sex and a lack of disease interventions at follow-up (P < 0.05).

Conclusions Long-COVID patients suffer prolonged, diffuse symptoms and poorer health. Vascular transformation blood biomarkers were significantly elevated in Long-COVID, with angiogenesis markers (ANG-1/P-SEL) providing classification accuracy of 96%. Vascular transformation blood biomarkers hold potential for diagnostics, and modulators of angiogenesis may have therapeutic efficacy.

","In this study, we measured 16 vascular transformation blood biomarkers obtained from age- and sex-matched Long-COVID outpatients, Ward COVID-19 inpatients, ICU COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects. To identify the leading biomarkers distinguishing Long-COVID patients from the other cohorts, we utilized both conventional statistics and state-of-the-art machine learning. Our data indicate a unique Long-COVID blood proteome; two vascular transformation biomarkers were identified that distinguished Long-COVID patients from acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects (classification accuracy of 96%). Our data suggest that one or both of the two leading biomarkers, ANG-1 and P-SEL, have potential as disease biomarkers. Moreover, given the primary roles of these two biomarkers in angiogenesis, accelerators or inhibitors of microvascular re-modelling may provide therapeutic potential for Long-COVID patients. The test data was validated in a consecutive, secondary Long-COVID patient cohort.
Our patient cohorts were similar to those reported in earlier studies with regards to demographics, comorbidities and clinical presentation. For example, Long-COVID patients were more likely to be older, have greater body mass index and be female sex (Sudre et al. 2021). They suffered diffuse symptoms, such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, anosmia and cognitive dysfunction, and across multiple organ systems (Davis et al. 2021; Carfì et al. 2020). With regards to acutely ill COVID-19 patients, they were similar to those reported in earlier cohorts (Myers et al. 2020; Bhatraju 2020; Zhou et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020), and as per multiple studies, suffered significant inflammatory and thrombotic mechanisms (Fraser et al. 2020a; Fraser et al. 2020c; Fraser et al. 2020d; Gill et al. 2020), associated with microvascular injury (Fraser et al. 2020b).
Our study has identified 14 vascular transformation proteins that are significantly elevated in Long-COVID outpatients, with the leading two proteins (ANG-1 and P-SEL) accurately identifying Long-COVID status. The strength of the leading two proteins for identifying Long-COVID status was demonstrated with both conventional statistics as well as state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We also provide a rank order listing of the importance of these two molecules relative to the full set of significantly different molecules, resulting in a limited biomarker profile for efficient clinical translatability. The molecules are critical for vascular transformation and suggest they play a wound-healing role in the Long-COVID patients. Information regarding the function of the other molecules is provided in the supplementary documents.
ANG-1, part of the angiopoietin family, is a secreted glycoprotein ligand that induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of TIE2 tyrosine kinase expressed exclusively in vascular endothelial cells and pericytes (Davis et al. 1996). Previous studies have shown ANG-1 to have vasculature protective effects including suppressing plasma leakage, inhibiting vascular inflammation, preventing endothelial death, and enlargement of existing vessels (Brindle et al. 2006; Thurston 2002). The Angiopoietin-TIE2 pathway defends against acute or chronic lung injury and disruptions in the pathway may lead to deterioration in microvascular integrity (Sack et al. 2020). ANG-2, an Angiopoietin-TIE2 antagonist, disrupts the vascular barrier and its elevation is associated with COVID-19 ICU mortality (Vassiliou et al. 2021). As COVID-19 patients have increased angiogenesis due to the endothelial injury (Ackermann 2020), the significantly elevated ANG-1 observed in our Long-COVID patients may represent a long-term, wound-repairing angiogenesis response.
P-SEL is a type-1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on endothelial cells and platelets (Tvaroška et al. 2020). During infection, the endothelium is activated and P-SEL facilitates platelet aggregation and adhesion (Furie and Furie 2004; Lorant et al. 1993). P-SEL also serves a critical role in angiogenesis by promoting early inflammatory mononuclear cell proliferation (Egami et al. 2006), and mediating endothelial cell migration (Morbidelli et al. 1998). P-SEL is acutely elevated in COVID-19, and it is associated with COVID-19 symptom severity (Fraser et al. 2020e; Venter et al. 2020; Goshua et al. 2020; Yatim, et al. 2021). Lymphocyte binding along specialized high endothelial venules is initiated by P-SEL (Diacovo et al. 1996), and may be associated with our observation of elevated lymphocytes in Long-COVID outpatients, relative to acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients. We could not establish an association between P-SEL and platelet number, suggesting the role of P-SEL in Long-COVID may be skewed towards angiogenesis and lymphocyte migration, rather than platelet aggregation.
Accumulating evidence suggests that females have a greater chance of being affected by Long-COVID (Sudre et al. 2021; Bai 2021). Given the sex- and age-matched nature of our study, the Long-COVID group has roughly an equal number of males (56.5%) and females (43.5%), and thus we cannot corroborate those findings directly. However, ANG-1 was significantly elevated in our female Long-COVID patients, as opposed to males.
Our study has also identified ANG-1 to be significantly elevated in Long-COVID individuals receiving no interventions at follow-up. There were no sex differences for individuals receiving interventions and those without interventions. These latter findings suggest that ANG-1 is critically important for angiogenesis and it is protective at higher levels, perhaps by hastening the healing response.
Long-COVID has been compared to Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is an overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest and worsened by any physical or mental exertion. Our data suggests that Long-COVID is biochemically distinct from ME/CFS as all 14 vascular transformation biomarkers increased significantly in plasma from Long-COVID patients when compared to healthy control subjects. In contrast, plasma levels of P-SEL, MMP-1, ICAM-1, VEGF-A and VEGF-D either do not change with ME/CFS or are depressed (VanElzakker et al. 2019; Roerink et al. 2017; Roerink et al. 2018). In addition, plasma ANG-1 is unchanged or depressed in common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (Senna et al. 2013) and systemic lupus erythematosus (Kümpers et al. 2009).
Our study has identified 14 significantly elevated vascular transformation biomarkers and developed a simple two-protein profile for Long-COVID status; however, our study has several limitations. First, our study investigated a conservative number of patients within each patient group. Nonetheless, we ensured robust analysis via non-parametric statistics and conservative machine learning techniques, and we validated the results in a larger independent cohort. Second, our data show elevated biomarkers in Long-COVID patients at one to six months (median 98.5 days) after acute infection, with clustering at approximately 100 days, but we did not have longitudinal samples from each of these patients to determine individual biomarker resolution. Third, our results demonstrate a potential for one or more vascular transformation biomarkers to identify Long-COVID status; however, we cannot be sure that the same biomarkers may cross-identify with other pathologies. Nonetheless, development of diffuse symptoms and biomarker changes after a PCR-positive acute illness, or in tandem with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody testing, would make cross-reactivity unlikely. Lastly, our comparison of the two selected proteins and clinical/demographic information was exploratory due to limited cohort patient numbers, but given the significant data and scarcity of knowledge on the altered physiological pathways in Long-COVID patients, our findings still provide valuable insights.

"A machine learning-based phenotype for long COVID in children: an EHR-based study from the RECOVER program
","Background
As clinical understanding of pediatric Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 (PASC) develops, and hence the clinical definition evolves, it is desirable to have a method to reliably identify patients who are likely to have post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 (PASC) in health systems data.
Methods and Findings
In this study, we developed and validated a machine learning algorithm to classify which patients have PASC (distinguishing between Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and non-MIS-C variants) from a cohort of patients with positive SARS- CoV-2 test results in pediatric health systems within the PEDSnet EHR network. Patient features included in the model were selected from conditions, procedures, performance of diagnostic testing, and medications using a tree-based scan statistic approach. We used an XGboost model, with hyperparameters selected through cross-validated grid search, and model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. Model predictions and feature importance were evaluated using Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.

","We have employed machine learning to identify potential patients with PASC based on EHR data collected during clinical care. As controls substantially outnumber cases in our cohort, accuracy and AUROC tend to be inflated, so we assessed our model’s performance primarily in terms of the Precision-Recall curve. At the p=0.5 threshold, our model was a high-precision classifier for PASC in general as well as for MIS-C and non-MIS-C PASC separately. Indeed, the model was able to classify patients with up to 70% recall with near perfect precision, with a drop-off in precision below 80% beginning only around 85% recall. At this threshold, our model’s high precision could be a valuable tool for identifying patients with PASC for study cohorts, particularly patients who did not receive a diagnosis due to unavailability of specific diagnosis codes, evolving clinical understanding of PASC, or less severe presentation. At lower probability thresholds, the model is potentially useful for identifying patients who may have features of PASC for further screening, such as might be done for clinical trial recruitment.
Review of feature contribution using SHAP value visualization reveals complex patterns, especially for non-MIS-C variants of PASC. In the more straightforward MIS-C case, the single diagnosis with consistent positive impact is ECG abnormalities; procedure codes show a similar pattern. Continuing this pattern, laboratory testing for inflammation and cardiac injury has a positive impact, while additional infection-related testing is more characteristic of unaffected patients. Aspirin, used only for a narrow set of indications in pediatrics, has the strongest positive influence among medications, with other immunomodulators associated with MIS-C (corticosteroid and immunoglobulin) appearing as well. SHAP data for the non-MIS-C group of patients reflects their greater heterogeneity. The skew toward later cohort entry despite masking of the PASC diagnosis code itself may reflect differences in PASC natural history, or in practice patterns for evaluation and treatment. Like children with MIS-C, lab utilization at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with caseness, but post-acute utilization is. However, no specific laboratory testing has a strong effect. Interestingly, several types of diagnostic imaging, but especially CT imaging during the acute phase of COVID19 may have positive predictive value. Among diagnoses, respiratory and neurologic codes in the early postacute period were observed to exert the greatest positive impact, consistent with respiratory medications, while aspirin and acetaminophen have negative impact, likely due to their role in MIS-C treatment. Coronavirus infection codes during the 1 to 2 month window suggests such codes are often still used for PASC-diagnosed patients during the post-acute period.
The model’s difficulties with the remaining 15% of PASC patients were driven by patients with non-MIS-C PASC. The lower recall for these patients could be a result of several factors. First, because the U09.9 diagnosis code was implemented in October 2021, there is a shorter overall duration for appropriately labelled cases to accrue in the training data. Though we attempted to mitigate this by including as cases patients who received more general post-viral disorder codes following a positive COVID test, it is possible that these more general codes were not used consistently. Additionally, non-MIS-C PASC patients had, on average, less follow-up time than patients with MIS-C. A second factor is that MIS-C is a more sharply defined condition with similarities to Kawasaki disease, an existing clinical phenotype, and thus there are features in the data related to diagnostic test utilization that align with consensus definitions of MIS-C (cf. Figure S2e). By contrast, we see more reliance on co-occurring symptoms and conditions to define non-MISC-PASC. These are more heterogeneous given the range of possible symptoms and presentations and likely include more characteristics that are poorly coded in discrete EHR data, such as fatigue or school difficulties.
We expect that our observed ceiling in recall at 85% may also reflect several limitations in the available training set. The primary challenge of using PASC diagnosis information in EHR data as a training standard, particularly for non-MIS-C PASC, is that the lack of a specific definition means the presence or absence of PASC-specific diagnosis codes does not constitute a gold standard for defining PASC. Moreover, patients who were seen with PASC and MIS-C may not have received the relevant diagnosis codes either due to the recent release of the codes or the early limited understanding of PASC, especially in the case of less severe sub-phenotypes. Thus, while diagnosis codes can serve as a starting point for assessing complications due to COVID-19, there is likely under-ascertainment of PASC which may result in false negative labels in our control population. The lack of a consensus definition may drive differences in clinical assignment of the code, and many patients may either be undiagnosed or never visit a clinician if the symptoms are not severe. On the other hand, false positives are also possible: many PASC features may reflect ongoing symptoms or conditions related to the acute COVID-19 infection, and therefore the lack of clear boundary between acute and post-acute symptoms and conditions may have led to patients in the acute phase of illness receiving a PASC diagnosis. Additionally, unlike adult care, there are relatively few institutional markers, such as dedicated long COVID-19 clinics, for patients with PASC, who receive their care in broader specialty settings such as cardiology or neurology. Lack of follow up for non-MIS-C PASC patients may also limit the model’s ability to identify distinguishing characteristics. The SHAP value plots indicate that many of the predictive features of PASC occur within the first three months from diagnosis, which may reflect this limitation.
When compared with adults, PASC in children may present with a milder clinical course21, leading to underdiagnosis in the health care setting. Some effects of PASC may have been seen in school performance or extracurricular participation, neither of which may have been captured in the HER. Pediatric PASC may less frequently involve focal organ dysfunction that prompts specific utilization, such as laboratory testing or diagnostic imaging which is well-captured in EHR data. Additionally, the majority of PASC manifestations in children possibly occur shortly following acute infection and resolve more rapidly than in adults10. These factors both require a distinct approach to classifying children with PASC and warrant further investigation as clinical guidelines and definitions are developed.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has applied machine learning to an exclusively pediatric population to identify patients with PASC. A recent study5 developed a machine learning phenotype in the adult population trained on classifying whether patients were seen at a long COVID clinic. The model achieved 0.92 AUROC with 0.85 precision and 0.86 recall, the latter being slightly greater than observed here. Differences between our model and theirs include our pediatric population, and the use of PASC diagnoses as an outcome rather than specialty clinic attendance, due to limited use of dedicated PASC clinics at pediatric institutions.
Of note, we believe this study is also the first to use TreeScan for clinical feature selection in a machine learning model. The sets of possible features in each domain number in the hundreds of thousands, making reduction of dimensionality a necessary part of model development. Further, it is difficult to identify the correct level of granularity at which concepts should be clustered to define model features. This can be addressed through clinician expertise but is a time-consuming process which may incorporate bias stemming from individual clinicians’ practices or the coding practices at their institutions. However, vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT or RxNorm have rich hierarchies based on physiology or chemical structure, respectively. TreeScan therefore presents an appealing alternative: it takes the hierarchical structure of clinical vocabularies into account and does not require pre-specifying the level of granularity at which features should be selected.
Our study does have additional limitations, many in common with other studies which use EHR data to investigate PASC, a new condition with a broad definition. First, our model was trained to classify whether patients had a PASC diagnosis, which does not include all patients having PASC. Patients with milder manifestations may have been less likely to receive a diagnosis and thus would be less likely to be detected by our model. Second, our model was trained on data from tertiary and quaternary pediatric health systems, and so it may reflect biases in access to care as well as clinicians’ practices. Though a matched cohort design could be used to address some of these biases, it would run counter to our purpose of identifying patients likely to have PASC from routine EHR data. Third, while using data from a variety of sites may avoid overfitting the model to site-specific coding practices, there could be bias arising from coding practices across PEDSnet, as a network of pediatric health systems. A fourth potential limitation stems from our approach to imputing index dates for patients with PASC. Due to our difficulty in accurately capturing the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection date for such patients, we used a random date between 28 and 90 days prior to the first PASC diagnosis as the index date. However, this may not accurately reflect the date of the patient’s SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a result, relevant features may appear in a different time window relative to infection than when they actually occurred. Given the short follow-up for many patients, this could lead to a model that heavily weighs data close in time to infection. Finally, as noted above, the limited availability of PASC and MIS-C diagnosis codes may have not only reduced follow-up but led to models that focus on manifestation associated with more recent viral variants.
There is substantial potential for future work as understanding of PASC develops and more data become available. Training on data with more cases could help address the model’s potential limitation due to heterogeneity of PASC (particularly non-MIS-C PASC). Clinician review of false positives from the model could be used to determine the extent to which PASC-likely patients as determined by the model may have been undiagnosed, and review of false negatives could indicate which features the model is either misinterpreting or failing to detect. Further, our planned validation of the model on sites outside the PEDSnet network will help to evaluate the model’s generalizability. Supplementing the model with other sources of clinical data such as unstructured chart notes could further improve model performance. Different features may be associated with PASC over different time periods relative to COVID infection. The tree temporal scan statistic has the potential to address this by picking out both features and time windows over which patients with PASC disproportionately have those features occur, and thereby construct a more refined feature space than the fixed windows we used.

"Stacking Ensemble-Based Intelligent Machine Learning Model for Predicting Post-COVID-19 Complications
","The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in healthcare crises across the globe. Moreover, the persistent and prolonged complications of post-COVID-19 or long COVID are also putting extreme pressure on hospital authorities due to the constrained healthcare resources. Out of many long-lasting post-COVID-19 complications, heart disease has been realized as the most common among COVID-19 survivors. The motivation behind this research is the limited availability of the post-COVID-19 dataset. In the current research, data related to post-COVID complications are collected by personally contacting the previously infected COVID-19 patients. The dataset is preprocessed to deal with missing values followed by oversampling to generate numerous instances, and model training. A binary classifier based on a stacking ensemble is modeled with deep neural networks for the prediction of heart diseases, post-COVID-19 infection. The proposed model is validated against other baseline techniques, such as decision trees, random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. Results show that the proposed technique outperforms other baseline techniques and achieves the highest accuracy of 93.23%. Moreover, the results of specificity (95.74%), precision (95.24%), and recall (92.05%) also prove the utility of the adopted approach in comparison to other techniques for the prediction of heart diseases.
","It is evident from the results that the proposed stacking ensemble approach performs significantly well and achieves the highest predictive accuracy of 93.23% in comparison to other baseline algorithms. Moreover, the results of specificity (95.74%), precision (95.24%), and recall (92.05%) prove the utility of the proposed approach compared to DT, RF, SVM, ANN. In addition, the results are also compared based on two statistical techniques namely, Root Mean square error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The proposed approach records the lowest value of RMSE (0.32) and MAE (0.23) amongst all the baseline algorithms. Based on this comparative analysis, it can be concluded that the stacking ensemble presented in the current study performs significantly better than the baseline techniques in all aspects.",,,
"Predictive Attributes for Developing Long COVID—A Study Using Machine Learning and Real-World Data from Primary Care Physicians in Germany
","1) In the present study, we used data comprising patient medical histories from a panel of primary care practices in Germany to predict post-COVID-19 conditions in patients after COVID-19 diagnosis and to evaluate the relevant factors associated with these conditions using machine learning methods. (2) Methods: Data retrieved from the IQVIATM Disease Analyzer database were used. Patients with at least one COVID-19 diagnosis between January 2020 and July 2022 were selected for inclusion in the study. Age, sex, and the complete history of diagnoses and prescription data before COVID-19 infection at the respective primary care practice were extracted for each patient. A gradient boosting classifier (LGBM) was deployed. The prepared design matrix was randomly divided into train (80%) and test data (20%). After optimizing the hyperparameters of the LGBM classifier by maximizing the F2 score, model performance was evaluated using several test metrics. We calculated SHAP values to evaluate the importance of the individual features, but more importantly, to evaluate the direction of influence of each feature in our dataset, i.e., whether it is positively or negatively associated with a diagnosis of long COVID. (3) Results: In both the train and test data sets, the model showed a high recall (sensitivity) of 81% and 72% and a high specificity of 80% and 80%; this was offset, however, by a moderate precision of 8% and 7% and an F2-score of 0.28 and 0.25. The most common predictive features identified using SHAP included COVID-19 variant, physician practice, age, distinct number of diagnoses and therapies, sick days ratio, sex, vaccination rate, somatoform disorders, migraine, back pain, asthma, malaise and fatigue, as well as cough preparations. (4) Conclusions: The present exploratory study describes an initial investigation of the prediction of potential features increasing the risk of developing long COVID after COVID-19 infection by using the patient history from electronic medical records before COVID-19 infection in primary care practices in Germany using machine learning. Notably, we identified several predictive features for the development of long COVID in patient demographics and their medical histories.","In this retrospective, exploratory study including more than 270,000 patients with COVID-19, a good prediction of long COVID was achieved using an LGBM classifier. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation on the prediction of potential features increasing the risk for developing Long-COVID after COVID-19 infection in primary care practices in Germany. Additionally, particularly novel is the use of electronic medical record data for the prediction of long COVID, having been performed only a few times, such as in [8]. Further, this is the first study that focuses on the first point of medical contact of patients.
The first finding of our study is the good performance of the LGBM classifier. In the train dataset, 81% of long COVID patients and 80% of non-long COVID patients were correctly identified by the model. In the test dataset, the proportions were 72% and 80%, respectively. Aktar et al. also successfully attempted to predict clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients based on different peripheral blood values, using several ML models to identify blood parameters that can predict the risk of serious illness among COVID-19 patients [22]. Furthermore, Sudre et al. predicted long COVID conditions based on symptoms during the first week of illness and sociodemographic factors [7] using a matched case–control design and achieved good model performance. Because the data set we used is unbalanced with respect to diagnoses (long COVID vs. no long COVID), and because it does not comprise case–control matched groups, direct comparison of model performance to many other studies is difficult. However, there was no marked drop in model goodness between train and test data, suggesting good generalizability of our model.
The second finding of our study is the identification of a number of important features. Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a time with a higher proportion of the Omicron-BA2 variant had a lower risk of developing long COVID, whereas a higher proportion of the wild type variant of SARS-CoV-2 was positively associated with the risk of developing long COVID. This finding is partly in line with other published research. Du et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including a total of 51 studies with 33,573 patients to evaluate the characteristics of long COVID caused by different SARS-CoV-2 variants. While authors suggested that there was no significant difference between different variants in terms of long COVID incidence, symptoms of long COVID differed strongly depending on SARS-CoV-2 variant. For example, ≥1 general symptoms and fatigue occurred most commonly in patients infected with the Alpha variant, followed by patients with the wild type strain, and less often among patients with the Omicron variant [23].
The second most important feature was the practice in which a patient was treated. The high importance of this variable is interesting, but not surprising, as it captures different diagnostic styles in medical practices. Especially with such new diagnostic codes and for such a heterogeneous clinical picture as long COVID, for which guidelines and information change rapidly, individual doctors can come to very different assessments as to whether or not a patient suffers from long COVID. Furthermore, some of the practices might also (begin to) treat long COVID with a focus, while other practices might not approach a diagnosis.
In our study, age 30–80 and female sex were associated with a higher risk of long COVID. Interestingly, in another study based on the same database but using logistic regression to analyze associations between different variables and long COVID, age 45–60 was associated with a 2.1 times higher risk of long COVID compared with age group 18–30; female sex was associated with a 1.2 times higher risk of developing long COVID. However, further variables such as asthma and somatoform disorders were also positively associated with long COVID [24]. Although the association between sex and long COVID is still insufficiently understood, several other studies also reported that the prevalence of long COVID was higher in women than in men [7,25,26,27,28,29].
Somatoform disorders which were associated with a higher risk of long COVID in our study can be characterized by symptoms such as back pain, headache, fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath without an adequate medical explanation. COVID-19 patients who have a coexisting somatoform disorder may harbor a belief that these symptoms are due to long COVID [30]. Another study from Poland which assessed factors associated with prolonged symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that female sex, asthma, history of myocardial infarction, and severity of symptoms in the acute phase of COVID-19 were the predictors of long COVID [31]. Two of these predictors (female sex, asthma) were found among the top 20 features in our study. Another study also used symptom severity in an early phase of COVID infection to successfully predict long COVID in a case–control designed analysis [7]. In addition to symptom severity and symptom quantity, female sex, age, and asthma were also predictive for long COVID in their study, nicely converging on our findings.
In our study, we observed a positive association between multimorbidity (multiple different diagnoses or a higher number of sick days before COVID-19 infection) with subsequent long COVID. Wilk et al. analyzed data from different European countries and found that multimorbid individuals had an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of long COVID, identifying a slightly increased relative risk of 1.12 for such individuals [32]. However, multimorbidity is known to impact COVID-19 severity and mortality as well as the risk of long COVID [27,33]. On the other hand, polypharmacy was negatively associated with the risk of long COVID in our study.
A further finding of our study is that a higher likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the risk of long COVID. Although we used a proxy for vaccination (cf. Methods), this finding is not surprising and was already reported in a systematic review by Notarte et al. [34]. Based on case–control and cohort studies included in this review, the authors suggested that vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce the risk of subsequent long COVID [34]. This finding is quite prevalent, such as, for example, in a recent meta-analysis [29].
Further variables included in the top 20 features identified by our model such as migraine, malaise and fatigue, or back pain include symptoms which can also occur as symptoms of long COVID (headache, back pain, fatigue). These symptoms may worsen after COVID-19 infection and, thus, transition to long COVID. In general, many physical and also mental disorders have been shown to increase risk for long COVID [27,28].
Prescription of cough medication and polypharmacy are two further variables that are included in our top 20 features. Considering the effect of polypharmacy, one could speculate, for example, that it counteracts the negative effect of multimorbidity when therapies have been claimed. However, making a statement is difficult, and an investigation of the time course and composition of the therapies would be necessary to understand the effect. The only single drug class that appears to be predictive and simultaneously protective was cough medication. Patients receiving cough medications might be more prone to the hazard of bronchial diseases. Therefore, those patients might have additional medications for the treatment of bronchial diseases mitigating acute COVID-19 symptoms, which are in turn predictive for long COVID [7]. Further research is needed here as well. All other individual drug groups did not make it onto the list of highly predictive features, unlike the individual diagnostic codes, some of which were represented.
The strengths of this study are the inclusion of more than 270,000 patients, the use of data from clinical practice, and the use of ML methodology. However, the study is also subject to several limitations, which should be acknowledged at this point. First, all diagnoses relied on ICD-10 codes pre-COVID-19 infection only, and no data were available on symptoms of long COVID. Second, long COVID may sometimes have been diagnosed in specialized practices (e.g., pneumology) or hospitals, and some of the related data may have gone undocumented in the Disease Analyzer database, potentially leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of this condition. The prevalence of long COVID observed in our study was much lower than that in published investigations, probably due to the rare use of the ICD-10 codes U09.9 in the first year after the beginning of the pandemic and also due to our exclusion criteria. Third, no medications used for COVID-19 therapy were analyzed, as these are usually given in hospitals and are only administered for severe courses of COVID-19. Fourth, viral variants were not determined individually for patients, but rather assigned based on the predominant variant at the time the patient was first diagnosed with COVID-19. Since we did not have any information about the genome sequence of the virus, the estimation via the time of infection and the inclusion of the epidemiological situation was the most obvious way to estimate the strain. However, an interpretation of the virus strains should be approached with caution and confirmed with actual sequencing studies. Fifth, we trained the model to achieve a high recall, and have compromised on a lower level of precision, therefore allowing for a high proportion of false positives to achieve a very low proportion of false negatives. The focus could have been set differently to achieve a better accuracy of the model. Since the main reason for us was to identify predictive features, we deliberately set a high recognition rate of long COVID patients in our model to correct for the underrepresentation of this diagnosis at the GP. Finally, limitations come with the analysis of real-world data, which are temporally unstructured and full of missing values compared with studies designed in a matched case–control fashion. Insights, however, highly converged on other studies using matched study designs and different data sources.

"A machine learning-based phenotype for long COVID in children: An EHR-based study from the RECOVER program

Model predictions and feature importance were evaluated using Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. The model provides a tool for identifying patients with PASC and an approach to characterizing PASC using diagnosis, medication, laboratory, and procedure features in health systems data. Using appropriate threshold settings, the model can be used to identify PASC patients in health systems data at higher precision for inclusion in studies or at higher recall in screening for clinical trials, especially in settings where PASC diagnosis codes are used less frequently or less reliably. Analysis of how specific features contribute to the classification process may assist in gaining a better understanding of features that are associated with PASC diagnoses.","We have employed machine learning to identify potential patients with PASC based on EHR data collected during clinical care. As controls substantially outnumber cases in our cohort, accuracy and AUROC tend to be inflated, so we assessed our model’s performance primarily in terms of the Precision-Recall curve. At the p = 0.5 threshold, our model was a high-precision classifier for PASC in general as well as for MIS-C and non-MIS-C PASC separately.

At lower probability thresholds, the model is potentially useful for identifying patients who may have features of PASC for further screening, such as might be done for clinical trial recruitment.
The model’s difficulties with the remaining 20% of PASC patients were driven by patients with non-MIS-C PASC. The lower recall for these patients could be a result of several factors.

Additionally, the majority of PASC manifestations in children possibly occur shortly following acute infection and resolve more rapidly than in adults [10]. These factors both require a distinct approach to classifying children with PASC and warrant further investigation as clinical guidelines and definitions are developed. Review of feature contribution using SHAP value visualization reveals complex patterns, especially for non-MIS-C variants of PASC. In the more straightforward MIS-C case, the diagnoses with greatest positive impact are mobility findings pre-diagnosis and vascular malformation post-diagnosis, possibly related to testing for coronary artery aneurysms (S2d Fig). Consistent with expectation, procedure codes show a positive contribution of cardiac testing (S2g Fig), and laboratory testing for inflammation has a positive impact (S2e Fig; labelling as a rheumatoid arthritis panel reflects TreeScan’s aggregation of specific tests into umbrella terms that subsume them), while additional infection-related testing is more characteristic of unaffected patients. Oral formulations targeted at younger children contribute positively to MIS-C classification, likely representing use of aspirin prophylaxis in these patients (S2f Fig).
SHAP data for the non-MIS-C group of patients reflects their greater heterogeneity. The skew toward later cohort entry despite masking of the PASC diagnosis code itself may reflect differences in PASC natural history, or in practice patterns for evaluation and treatment (S2a Fig). Like children with MIS-C, lab utilization at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with caseness, but post-acute utilization is (S2b and S2c Fig). Interestingly, testing for inflammatory markers in the acute period is also a positive influence for non-MIS-C PASC classification, while evaluation of infectious diseases is not, possibly reflective of MIS-C-informed practice patterns. In contrast to MIS-C, however, respiratory medications contribute more positively to the non-MIS-C PASC scoring (S2f Fig). Similarly, early thoracic imaging has positive predictive value; while electrocardiography shows positive effect, echocardiography does not, in contrast to MIS-C (S2g Fig). Among diagnoses, respiratory and neurologic codes were observed to exert the greatest positive impact (S2d Fig). Overall, this constellation of factors suggests that the presence of persistent respiratory problems is most characteristic of the non-MIS-C PASC group, with a lesser contribution of persistent pain.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has applied machine learning to an exclusively pediatric population to identify patients with PASC. A recent study [5] developed a machine learning phenotype in the adult population trained on classifying whether patients were seen at a long COVID clinic. The model achieved 0.92 AUROC with 0.85 precision and 0.86 recall, the latter being slightly greater than observed here. Differences between our model and theirs include our pediatric population, and the use of PASC diagnoses as an outcome rather than specialty clinic attendance, due to limited use of dedicated PASC clinics at pediatric institutions.
Of note, we believe this study is also the first to use a tree-based scan statistic for clinical feature selection in a machine learning model. The sets of possible features in each domain number in the hundreds of thousands, making reduction of dimensionality a necessary part of model development. Further, it is difficult to identify the correct level of granularity at which concepts should be clustered to define model features. This can be addressed through clinician expertise but is a time-consuming process which may incorporate bias stemming from individual clinicians’ practices or the coding practices at their institutions. However, vocabularies such as SNOMED CT or RxNorm have rich hierarchies based on physiology or chemical structure, respectively. A tree-based scan statistic approach therefore presents an appealing alternative: it takes the hierarchical structure of clinical vocabularies into account and does not require pre-specifying the level of granularity at which features should be selected.
Our study does have additional limitations, many in common with other studies which use EHR data to investigate PASC, a new condition with a broad definition. First, our model was trained to classify whether patients had a PASC diagnosis, which does not include all patients having PASC. Patients with milder manifestations may have been less likely to receive a diagnosis and thus would be less likely to be detected by our model. Second, our model was trained on data from tertiary and quaternary pediatric health systems, and so it may reflect biases in access to care as well as clinicians’ practices. Though a matched cohort design could be used to address some of these biases, it would run counter to our purpose of identifying patients likely to have PASC from routine EHR data. Third, while using data from a variety of sites may avoid overfitting the model to site-specific coding practices, there could be bias arising from coding practices across PEDSnet, as a network of pediatric health systems. A fourth potential limitation stems from our approach to imputing index dates for patients with PASC. Due to our difficulty in accurately capturing the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection date for such patients, we used a random date between 28 and 90 days prior to the first PASC diagnosis as the index date. However, this may not accurately reflect the date of the patient’s SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a result, relevant features may appear in a different time window relative to infection than when they actually occurred. Given the short follow-up for many patients, this could lead to a model that heavily weighs data close in time to infection. Finally, as noted above, the limited availability of PASC and MIS-C diagnosis codes may have not only reduced follow-up but led to models that focus on manifestation associated with more recent viral variants.
There is substantial potential for future work as understanding of PASC develops and more data become available. Training on data with more cases could help address the model’s potential limitation due to heterogeneity of PASC (particularly non-MIS-C PASC). Clinician review of false positives from the model could be used to determine the extent to which PASC-likely patients as determined by the model may have been undiagnosed, and review of false negatives could indicate which features the model is either misinterpreting or failing to detect. Further, our planned validation of the model on sites outside the PEDSnet network will help to evaluate the model’s generalizability. Supplementing the model with other sources of clinical data such as unstructured chart notes could further improve model performance. Different features may be associated with PASC over different time periods relative to COVID infection. The tree temporal scan statistic has the potential to address this by picking out both features and time windows over which patients with PASC disproportionately have those features occur, and thereby construct a more refined feature space than the fixed windows we used.",,,
"Predictive models of long COVID
","Background
The cause and symptoms of long COVID are poorly understood. It is challenging to predict whether a given COVID-19 patient will develop long COVID in the future.
Methods
We used electronic health record (EHR) data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to predict the incidence of long COVID. We trained two machine learning (ML) models — logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Features used to train predictors included symptoms and drugs ordered during acute infection, measures of COVID-19 treatment, pre-COVID comorbidities, and demographic information. We assigned the ‘long COVID’ label to patients diagnosed with the U09.9 ICD10-CM code. The cohorts included patients with (a) EHRs reported from data partners using U09.9 ICD10-CM code and (b) at least one EHR in each feature category. We analysed three cohorts: all patients (n = 2,190,579; diagnosed with long COVID = 17,036), inpatients (149,319; 3,295), and outpatients (2,041,260; 13,741).
Findings
LR and RF models yielded median AUROC of 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Ablation study revealed that drugs had the highest influence on the prediction task. The SHAP method identified age, gender, cough, fatigue, albuterol, obesity, diabetes, and chronic lung disease as explanatory features. Models trained on data from one N3C partner and tested on data from the other partners had average AUROC of 0.75.

","We predicted long COVID occurrence in COVID-19 patients using EHR data. For this classification task, we used existing comorbidities in patients, symptoms, drugs, and measures of treatment during the acute infection, and patient demographics.
The performance of the RF method was virtually identical to that of the LR (Fig. 3). While AUROC scores were promising in all the experiments, the AUPRC scores were low (Fig. 3), possibly due to the low prevalence of long COVID diagnosis in our cohorts. For example, the RF model had a median AUPRC of 0.04 (IQR = 0.00) in the all-patient cohort (proportion of long COVID patients in cohort = 0.78%). Thus, the model was approximately five times better than a random predictor. Similarly the model outperformed the random predictor by four times in inpatients (2.21%), and was three times better in outpatients (0.67%). Further, we evaluated the same trained models on four additional testing datasets. These datasets contained testing records with varying ratios of positive and negative samples, namely 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10. We observed a decline in the AUPRC scores as the proportion of the negative samples in the testing dataset increased (Supplementary Figure S7), while the AUROC scores remained the same (Supplementary Figure S8). The AUPRC metric captures the imbalance in datasets by accounting for both precision and recall. On the other hand, the AUROC metric utilises only the true and false positive rates.
The ablation study helped us compare the value added by each of the feature categories to predicting long COVID. Drugs had the highest predictive information when compared to the other four feature categories (Fig. 4). The exclusion of drugs caused an average decrease of 5.06% in the median AUROC scores of the models in all patients.
Prognosis models for complex conditions such as long COVID are generally built and evaluated using data from the same source.7,13 However, when they are validated externally, though seldom, we find large decrements in performance. Those large decrements often make it unwise to use the models to stratify data from any institutions other than the training data sites. Thus, it is important to assess the performance of models across many data partners, distinct from the training data sites. These observations motivated our novel cross-site analysis (Results: Cross-site Analysis). We trained models on only one data partner (1 or 2) and tested on data from all other partners. We compared the performance of these models with the performance of models trained and tested on data from all partners. With LR trained on EHR from only data partner 1, we observed a decrease in the median AUROC in all patients (decrease = 1.32%, p-value = 0.0002, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test), inpatients (18.92%, 0.0002), and outpatients (0.00%, 0.0002). The differences were similar for the RF model and for both models trained only on data from partner 2. Although the performance decrements were statistically significant (Supplementary Table S8 (Statistical Test Results)), the magnitudes of the decreases were small for all patients and outpatients, and it was noticeable for inpatients. This suggested that data from a single data partner may not sufficiently capture the variation in inpatients’ data across the N3C due to differences in population, care and data quality, and medical practices, thereby impeding the generalizability of the prediction models for inpatients.
We computed SHAP37 values of features to analyse their importance in the prediction task (Fig. 6, Supplementary Figures S3–S5). Among the top features, we observed that LR utilised all five types of features whereas RF did not rely on symptoms to make decisions. 21 features appeared in the top 30 features of both the prediction models as well as in the local interpretations of individual test samples. These features included gender, age at COVID index date, severity of the COVID-19 infection, drugs such as acetaminophen (prevalence = 10.32%), albuterol (4.58%), remdesivir during COVID hospitalisation (1.95%), and albuterol ipratropium (1.05%), and comorbidities such as heart failure (3.53%), hypertension (21.14%), obesity (32.70%), kidney disease (6.57%), chronic lung disease (12.23%), diabetes (16.93%), depression (11.63%), and coronary artery disease (4.90%).
There are stark differences in the data sources and types, patient populations, features, and definitions of long COVID considered in prior studies7,8,13,17,40 that characterise long COVID. This diversity limits the extent to which we can directly compare our results to the existing studies. Nevertheless, there is significant support for the features we identified as having high SHAP values. Higher age of patients (feature importance rank for LR = 2, feature importance rank for RF = 14), female sex (LR = 1, RF = 29), and treatment metrics such as severity of COVID-19 infection (LR = 26, RF = 20) and length of hospitalisation (LR = 24, RF = 36) are well-known risk factors of long COVID.4,5,7,13,14 Existing studies validate that chest-pain (LR = 38, RF = 38)7 has been found to persist in long COVID patients. Comorbidities such as obesity (LR = 5, RF = 6), anxiety and/or depression (LR = 7, RF = 24), dementia (RF = 8), diabetes (LR = 33, RF = 10), kidney disease (LR = 32, RF = 7), and chronic lung disease (LR = 6, RF = 11) are risk factors for long COVID.4,5,14,41 Treatments provided during and after the acute COVID-19 infection such as melatonin (LR = 18)7 and polyethylene glycol 3350 (LR = 36)7 are also indicative of long COVID.
As in the ablation study, we observed that drugs played a crucial role in classifying patients. Benzonatate and guaifenesin are used for respiratory symptoms. Albuterol is a bronchodilator used for asthma, wheezing, and respiratory symptoms caused by viral infections. These drugs have been used on a large scale for symptomatic relief in COVID-19 infections.42 Dexamethasone and prednisone are corticosteroid medications used to decrease the immune response, which might have detrimental effects, in COVID-19.43,44 While the role of corticosteroids in long COVID treatment is under investigation, these agents may reduce the symptoms and some of the immunological alterations present in long COVID.45 Patients hospitalised with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection have been treated with corticosteroids and remdesivir.45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 While melatonin is a mild sleep aid, a study found decreased mortality in patients treated with it.51 Melatonin has also been proposed as an adjuvant treatment in COVID-1952,53 and for treating long COVID.54 Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis. In COVID-19, enoxaparin used prophylactically has been associated with a significant reduction of mortality.55 Antihistamines and azithromycin have been proposed for the early treatment of COVID-19 for severity reduction and long COVID. While the exact mechanism of antihistamines causing the antiviral effect remains unclear, studies hypothesise that antihistamines inhibit the proinflammatory cytokine storm and virus binding in COVID-19.56, 57, 58, 59 The use of these drugs suggests that the corresponding comorbidities and symptoms might increase the risk of long COVID.
We conclude this section with the limitations of our study. First, as reported by Pfaff et al.,7 the laboratory data are sparsely represented in the N3C Enclave. The proportion of missing values in the harmonised measurements ranged from 68.25% to 99.99%. Therefore, we did not include laboratory test values measured during the acute COVID-19 infection as features. Furthermore, three years after the emergence of COVID-19, information about the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccinations administered to patients may play an important role in the development of long COVID in COVID-19 patients.4 However, N3C Enclave lacked this data at the time of performing this study.
Second, EHRs are biased towards patients seeking health care or having health insurance at institutions that have partnered with the N3C. Moreover, the lack of data about a patient in N3C cannot be definitively associated with the absence of the disease condition. The demographic information of the patient cohorts in Supplementary Table S1 shows that a higher number of people in the age group 51–80 years were hospitalised. The cohorts also had a significantly higher representation of patients whose race is ‘white’ while males were slightly over represented than females. Thus, the cohorts do not guarantee a holistic representation of all COVID-19 patients.
Finally, literature estimates of the proportion of COVID-19 patients who have long COVID range from 10 to 70%6,14 and are much larger than the approximate 0.3% of long COVID patients in our cohorts. The American version of the 2022 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code U09.9, which we used to label long COVID patients, was released on October 1, 2021. Prior to this date, patients were diagnosed using the more general ICD-10-CM code B94.8,60 which includes all forms of sequelae of unspecified infectious and parasitic diseases not already encapsulated by the ICD-10-CM codes in the range B90–B94.60 Since our study considered longitudinal data starting from January 1, 2018, it is likely that some of the early long COVID patients may have been diagnosed with the ICD-10-CM code B94.8. Besides, the adoption of the U09.9 code for long COVID diagnosis by the health institutions has been slow.12 Hence, we analysed the EHRs of patients labelled incorrectly as long COVID patients by our prediction models, i.e., false positives (Supplementary Method: B94.8 analysis). 8.78% of them were diagnosed with the ICD-10-CM code B94.8. There is no data available in the N3C on the nuances of the usage of U09.9 code such as the number of long COVID patients seeking clinical referral being accounted for in this code. McGrath et al. studied the adoption and use of this code in the US using commercial insurance claims data and found that 50.9% of the long COVID data came from outpatient settings whereas 6.8% was from inpatients. However, 37.2% of the U09.9 diagnosis could not be traced back to categorizable sources.21

"Post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease: Insights from a machine learning radiographic model
","Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 seem to be an emerging global crisis. Machine learning radiographic models have great potential for meticulous evaluation of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (ILD).
In this multicenter, retrospective study, we included consecutive patients that had been evaluated 3 months following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between 01/02/2021 and 12/5/2022. High-resolution computed tomography was evaluated through Imbio Lung Texture Analysis 2.1.
Two hundred thirty-two (n = 232) patients were analyzed. FVC% predicted was ≥80, between 60 and 79 and <60 in 74.2% (n = 172), 21.1% (n = 49), and 4.7% (n = 11) of the cohort, respectively. DLCO% predicted was ≥80, between 60 and 79 and <60 in 69.4% (n = 161), 15.5% (n = 36), and 15.1% (n = 35), respectively. Extent of ground glass opacities was ≥30% in 4.3% of patients (n = 10), between 5 and 29% in 48.7% of patients (n = 113) and <5% in 47.0% of patients (n = 109). The extent of reticulation was ≥30%, 5–29% and <5% in 1.3% (n = 3), 24.1% (n = 56), and 74.6% (n = 173) of the cohort, respectively. Patients (n = 13, 5.6%) with fibrotic lung disease and persistent functional impairment at the 6-month follow-up received antifibrotics and presented with an absolute change of +10.3 (p = 0.01) and +14.6 (p = 0.01) in FVC% predicted at 3 and 6 months after the initiation of antifibrotic.","This is the first study in Caucasian population aiming to investigate post-COVID-19-ILD through a machine learning radiographic model. Our report presented in detail the functional and radiographic impact of this entity and validated previous evidence showing that a considerable proportion of patients is experiencing functional impairment several months following infection. Fibrotic lung disease was observed in a substantial minority of COVID-19 survivors. These patients might experience benefit from antifibrotic initiation at the time point that fibrotic-like changes are “immature.”
Our study exhibited a number of important attributes that should be presented. First, we evaluated disease extent through a machine learning model. Manual interpretation of radiographic abnormalities extent is hindered by variability, especially at centers with lack of expertise (17). Deep learning might be the key to overcome barriers for fast and massive radiological evaluation in an unbiased fashion. Deep learning could be deployed all over the world and provide homogeneous and accurate reporting (21–23). Second, we demonstrated that a short course of antifibrotics could significantly improve lung function. Third, based on the fact that the majority of our cohort was unvaccinated against COVID-19, we provided indirect evidence that vaccination against COVID-19 is not only the best way to contain the pandemic but also the best way to limit post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.
Percentage of patients with functional and radiographic impairment is in line from data of other countries (24–32). In the 3-month follow-up, almost 30% of this cohort presented with DLCO% predicted below 80. A recent, large study in China showed in the 6-month follow-up that DLCO% predicted was below 80 in 21% of patients that were not in need of oxygen supplementation and in 57% of hospitalized patients that presented with WHO ordinal scale of 5 or 6 (32). Reticulation >5% was observed in almost one out of four patients in this study. Other studies reported that fibrotic like changes ranged from 22.5 to 35% in the 6-month follow-up (26, 30). Importantly, we observed fibrotic lung disease and substantial functional impairment in 5.6% of this cohort. Previous studies reported significant functional deficit in almost 5% of COVID-19 survivors, while the prevalence of the so called post-COVID-19 interstitial lung damage was estimated between 6.5 and 8.3% (24, 25). Suggested risk factors for post-COVID-19 fibrotic lung disease have been male gender, increased age, increased body mass index, duration of hospitalization >17 days, disease severity, extent of baseline radiographic lesions, intensity of ventilatory support, persistent viremia and Epstein–Barr reactivation, diabetes mellitus, and presence of auto-antibodies (32–38).
With regards to treatment of post-COVID-19-ILD, a minority of our patients received oral corticosteroids. Percentage of treated patients in this cohort is comparable to a previously published large study reporting that corticosteroids were suggested initially in 35/837 COVID-19 survivors and finally prescribed in 3.6% (n = 30) of patients (24). Importantly, high doses of prednisolone (40 mg tapered) were not superior to lower doses (10 mg tapered) in patients with post-COVID-19-ILD (39). In the context of “fibrotic-like” changes, sequelae consistent with “fibrotic-like” parenchymal lung disease has been observed following COVID-19 infection in a minority of patients and importantly these changes seem to lack of resolution in a considerable proportion of cases (40); yet, estimates must be interpreted cautiously due to substantial heterogeneity, differences in study casemix, and baseline severity among studies (41). Antifibrotics were prescribed in a substantial minority of this cohort. Pirfenidone was administered more often, as a considerable proportion of patients had history of pulmonary embolism following COVID-19 infection or was receiving anticoagulants due to chronic heart disease. While high quality trials aiming to address their role in post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease are greatly anticipated (42–44), observational studies have suggested that antifibrotics might confer benefit (45, 46) with regards to radiologic improvement and time to recovery in patients with sustained and extensive fibrotic changes. The concept of antifibrotics implementation in a minority of patients at the time point that fibrotic-like changes are “immature” deserves further investigation (47). It is a matter of ongoing debate if all abnormalities characterized as “fibrotic-like” can reliably indicate irreversible disease in a post-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome setting (48, 49). Eminent fibrotic-like changes and architectural distortion on HRCT is not necessarily synonymous with irreversible lung scarring, particularly in the context of a post-infectious syndrome (50). Similarly, bronchiectatic-like lesions during the acute phase of a respiratory infection may not necessarily represent irreversible and permanent enlargement of the airways but may largely resolve following resolution of the infection. Even if “fibrotic-like” changes on HRCT represent histologic fibrosis in a subgroup of cases, remodeling and regression of “immature” fibrosis represents an anticipated phenomenon following severe acute lung injury (49–51). In such cases, antifibrotics might be beneficial. Machine learning models might be helpful for the appropriate classification and selection of patients likely to benefit from antifibrotics as they may quantify in an unbiased and accurate fashion the extent and the type of lesions.
Our trial has some limitations. First, our report has the inherent weaknesses of a retrospective study. Second, follow-up period of patients under antifibrotics is relatively short given that post-COVID-19-ILD is a new entity; yet, even in this short period, our study provided evidence that antifibrotics might confer significant benefit if applied early during the post-COVID-19 syndrome when fibrotic-like changes appear to be “immature.” Third, a major limitation is that this cohort has not undergone HRCT prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to compare pre and post-infection radiographic abnormalities and identify a subset of patients with pre-existing ILD patterns. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients with functional and radiographic impairment is similar to other published reports and importantly our aim was to highlight the need of early detection and management of interstitial lung disease. Moreover, based on current guidelines, HRCT during infection was not performed in all cases, while PFTs could not be performed at the acute phase due to safety considerations. Thus, we could not compare radiographic and functional status between the acute phase and the 3-month follow-up. Finally, based on the fact we used a common algorithm and treated similarly all cases of same severity, we could not compare patients that receive antifibrotics with other patients of same phenotype that didn’t. Besides, this was not a randomized-controlled trial. This was a real-life study aiming to present outcomes following management with a common algorithm and using a highly novel machine learning radiographic model.
Collectively, post-COVID-19-ILD represents an emerging entity. Given that a considerable proportion of infected individuals has functional impairment several months after infection, screening 3 months following infection is encouraged, especially for severe cases that have been hospitalized for prolonged periods. On the other hand, post-COVID-19 HRCT screening may confer several other benefits, including identification of incidental lung cancer lesions, considering that the majority of patients screened for post-COVID-19 present with several risk factors for lung cancer, such as age, smoking status and comorbidities, and including chronic respiratory diseases. Current evidence does not support irrational use of corticosteroids; yet, short-term corticosteroids might confer benefit to specific patients with organizing pneumonia, functional impairment and persistent clinical symptoms without compromising patients’ immune status. Finally, a minority of these patients with persistent fibrotic lung lesions and functional disability, despite steroid treatment, could benefit from antifibrotic therapy, if applied early on during disease clinical course. Machine learning radiographic models might have a cardinal role for precise, unbiased and quantitative radiographic evaluation which may guide therapeutic decisions.

"Machine learning based predictive model and systems-level network of host-microbe interactions in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis
","Mucormycosis, a rare infection is caused by fungi Mucorales. The affiliation of mucormycosis with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rising issue of concern in India. There have been numerous case reports of association of rhino-cerebral-orbital, angioinvasive, pulmonary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract related mucormycosis in patients with history of COVID-19. The immune dysregulation, preposterous use of steroids, interleukin-6-directed therapies and mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 immunocompromised individuals hypothesizes and predisposes to advancement of mucormycosis. The gaps in mode of presentation, disease course, diagnosis and treatment of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis requires critical analysis in order to control its morbidity and incidence and for prevention and management of opportunistic infections in COVID-19 patients.
Our study performs machine learning, systems biology and bioinformatics analysis of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis in India incorporating multitudinous techniques. Text mining identifies candidate characteristics of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases including city, gender, age, symptoms, clinical parameters, microorganisms and treatment. The characteristics are incorporated in a machine learning based disease model resulting in predictive potentiality of characteristics of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis. The characteristics are used to create a host-microbe interaction disease network comprising of interactions between microorganism, host-microbe proteins, non-specific markers, symptoms and drugs resulting in candidate molecules. R1A (Replicase polyprotein 1a) and RPS6 (Ribosomal Protein S6) are yielded as potential drug target and biomarker respectively via potentiality analysis and expression in patients. The potential risk factors, drug target and biomarker can serve as prognostic, early diagnostic and therapeutic molecules in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis requiring further experimental validation and analysis on post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases.
","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in China in December 2019 and was declared pandemic in March 2020. The first wave of COVID-19 was seen in India in mid-2020 peaking in September. The major associated symptoms were fatigue, fever, cough, headache and myalgia. Mortality was seen highest in elders with pre-existing co-morbidities leading to hypoxia and multi-organ failure. India saw its second wave in March 2021 peaking in May with more severity due to mutations in virus strain affecting even the younger group without pre-existing comorbidities and with delayed complications (thrombo-embolic episodes and mucormycosis) despite of full recovery [[16], [17], [33], [35]]
Mucormycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection, caused by Zygomycetes (Rhizopus, Rhizomucor and Cunninghamella) has been observed as a complication in post-COVID-19 cases during the second wave of COVID-19 in India mainly involving rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and encephalic areas. It leads to vascular invasion and gradually causes thrombosis and tissue damage. The hypothesized pathophysiological causes of COVID-19 leading to fungal infections include immune dysregulation, ciliary dysfunction, thromboinflammation, cytokine storm, microvascular hypercoagulability, tissue necrosis, long standing and poorly controlled diabetes, chronic pulmonary disorder, renal failure, leukemia, lymphoma, neutropenia, organ transplant, prolonged use of steroids in severe cases, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, mechanical ventilation, unhygienic conditions in hospital stay and use of low-grade oxygen [1,2,18].
Non-specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are used to control the infection such as histopathological analysis for identifying hyphae of fungus in biopsy, surgical debridement of tissue, antifungal therapy and use of liposomal amphotericin B ([[4], [34]]. A published report has mentioned the use of MSC-based therapy along with combination of short-term antifungal drugs for prospective treatment of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis [19].
Early diagnosis, prognosis and targeted treatment is necessary for prevention of related life-threatening complications and to reduce morbidity and mortality of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis.
Our study employed machine learning, systems biology and bioinformatics techniques such as text mining, host-pathogen interaction, host protein-marker interaction, host protein-symptom interaction, microbial protein-drug interaction and potentiality analysis to create a predictive disease model and host-microbe disease network of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis retrieving potential molecules of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis.
The recent articles regarding post-COVID-19 mucormycosis in India mostly focus on case reports, case-control studies and reviews. To the best of our knowledge, our research article is the first paper focusing on basic research utilising in-depth machine learning, systems biology and bioinformatics data creating a disease model and host-microbe interaction disease network to predict risk factors, drug targets and biomarkers that can be utilized by clinicians and researchers to improve the prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases in India requiring further substantiation.
Text mining indicates the candidate characteristics of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis consisting of 12 cities, more in males, age group 28–73 years, 47 symptoms with maximum diabetic cases, 21 clinical parameters, 3 microorganisms and 12 therapies. These have been ascertained from 14 case reports of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis in India having diverse demographic and clinical characteristics [[3], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [35], [37]].
The machine learning based predictive model portrays the COVID-19 cases having the risk of attaining mucormycosis with 99% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 99% area under the receiver operator curve showing the potentiality of the candidate characteristics that can be utilized for prognosis of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis.
The characteristics were incorporated for further bioinformatics analysis to create a host-microbe interaction disease network. 16, 11 and 5 proteins respectively were retrieved for target microorganisms obtained via text mining namely Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), Rhizopus oryzae/arrhizus and Rhizopus microspores. These microorganisms have been observed in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases after performing histopathological analysis using palate, nasal, renal, necrotic and orbital tissue and biopsy samples/swabs incorporating fungal staining. 4 SARS-COV-2 microbial proteins having interaction with 5 human proteins and 2 Rhizopus oryzae/arrhizus microbial proteins having interaction with 2 human proteins were obtained. 5 out of 7 human proteins had interaction among themselves and with 5 non-specific marker proteins namely CRP (C-Reactive Protein), HBA1 (Hemoglobin Subunit Alpha 1), IL-6 (Interleukin 6), LDHB (Lactate Dehydrogenase B) and ALB (Albumin) extracted via text mining observed after performing laboratory investigations in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases. The human proteins had interaction with 30 symptoms namely abdomen pain, asthma, constipation, cough, diabetes, dyspnea, epistaxis, eye pain, eye swelling, face pain, face swelling, fever, flank edema, flank pain, headache, hypertension, hypotension, hypoxia, neutropenia, ophthalmoplegia, peritonitis, proptosis, ptosis, retinopathy, sepsis, tachycardia, tachypnea, thrombosis, vision loss and vomiting extracted via text mining observed after performing ultrasound, doppler, computed tomography, sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, angiography and other tests/examinations in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases.
The interactions between microorganism, host-microbe proteins, non-specific markers, symptoms and drugs give rise to a host-microbe interaction disease network showing candidate and potential molecules of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis.
RPS6 was found to have maximum interactions with non-specific markers and symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 mucormycosis and has been found to be expressed in COVID-19 cases as per published studies [31]. R1A (Replicase polyprotein 1a), a microbial protein having interaction with RPS6 shows interaction with Amphotericin used to control post-COVID-19 mucormycosis and is found to be essential and non-homologous protein against human host. Therefore, RPS6 and R1A can be regarded as potential biomarker and drug target respectively serving as early diagnostic and therapeutic molecules in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis.
Apart from these, parallel molecules for post-COVID-19 mucormycosis are present in host-microbe disease network created in our study that can be utilized further as disease determinants.
The information regarding the host-microbe interactions can serve as a vital indicator for prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for post-COVID-19 mucormycosis requiring prospective experimental validation and substantiation in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis cases.

A new hybrid ensemble machine-learning model for severity risk assessment and post-COVID prediction system,"Starting from December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has globally strained medical resources and caused significant mortality. It is commonly recognized that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease depends on both the comorbidity and the state of the patient's immune system, which is reflected in several biomarkers. The development of early diagnosis and disease severity prediction methods can reduce the burden on the health care system and increase the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation of patients with severe cases. This study aims to develop and validate an ensemble machine-learning model based on clinical and immunological features for severity risk assessment and post-COVID rehabilitation duration for SARS-CoV-2 patients. The dataset consisting of 35 features and 122 instances was collected from Lviv regional rehabilitation center. The dataset contains age, gender, weight, height, BMI, CAT, 6-minute walking test, pulse, external respiration function, oxygen saturation, and 15 immunological markers used to predict the relationship between disease duration and biomarkers using the machine learning approach. The predictions are assessed through an area under the receiver-operating curve, classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score performance metrics. A new hybrid ensemble feature selection model for a post-COVID prediction system is proposed as an automatic feature cut-off rank identifier. A three-layer high accuracy stacking ensemble classification model for intelligent analysis of short medical datasets is presented. Together with weak predictors, the associative rules allowed improving the classification quality. The proposed ensemble allows using a random forest model as an aggregator for weak repressors' results generalization. The performance of the three-layer stacking ensemble classification model (AUC 0.978; CA 0.920; F1 score 0.921; precision 0.924; recall 0.920) was higher than five machine learning models, viz. tree algorithm with forward pruning; Naïve Bayes classifier; support vector machine with RBF kernel; logistic regression, and a calibrated learner with sigmoid function and decision threshold optimization. Aging-related biomarkers, viz. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD22+ were examined to predict post-COVID rehabilitation duration. The best accuracy was reached in the case of the support vector machine with the linear kernel (MAPE = 0.0787) and random forest classifier (RMSE = 1.822). The proposed three-layer stacking ensemble classification model predicted SARS-CoV-2 disease severity based on the cytokines and physiological biomarkers. The results point out that changes in studied biomarkers associated with the severity of the disease can be used to monitor the severity and forecast the rehabilitation duration.","Over the past two years, SARS-CoV-2 disease has become one of the most significant burdens to the global health care system, causing fatalities and significantly depleting health care resources. The disease can occur differently for different patients: from asymptomatic illness to hospitalization in the intensive care unit or even death. The question of what determines the severity of the disease is of interest to researchers worldwide. However, there is still no definitive answer to this question. It is commonly recognized that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease depends on both the comorbidity and the state of the patient's immune system, which is reflected in several biomarkers that can be obtained from biochemical laboratory studies. Artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning, can help conduct such clinical trials, as they can work with smaller data samples when using appropriate approaches. A study with a smaller sample of data, in this case, makes it possible to reduce the time to collect the dataset, which will reduce the number of clinical patients, and enable using predictive results faster, which will allow preventive measures for patients with potentially severe disease. This, in turn, can reduce the burden on the health care system and increase the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation of patients with severe cases. Based on a dataset collected at the Lviv regional rehabilitation center, which contains anonymized information on the immune profile and other important diagnostic indicators, including external respiration function and oxygen saturation, a post-COVID rehabilitation duration classification model was built using ensembling of machine learning methods. A new hybrid ensemble feature selection model and a three-layer stacking ensemble classification model have been developed. The proposed hybrid ensemble feature selection model for a machine learning-based post-COVID prediction system can be used as an automatic feature cut-off rank identifier. The three-layer stacking ensemble classification model shows high accuracy for intelligent analysis of short medical datasets. The associative rules, together with weak predictors, improve the classification quality. The proposed ensemble uses a random forest model as an aggregator for weak repressors' results generalization. The developed three-layer stacking ensemble classification model with Logistic Regression aggregate has the following values of performance evaluation metrics in the selected feature subset: area under ROC curve – 0.908; classification accuracy – 0.840; F1 score – 0.842; precision – 0.867; recall – 0.840. To summarize, the proposed model achieved a good prediction of SARS-CoV-2 disease severity based on the cytokines and physiological biomarkers. The results point out that changes in studied biomarkers associated with the severity of the disease may be used to monitor the severity and 6120 Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering Volume 19, Issue 6, 6102–6123. forecast the rehabilitation duration. The main results are given below: • COVID-19 treatment duration, both in days and categorical (i.e., long and short), is predicted based on the important biomarkers obtained by blood cytokines profiling using a machine learning approach. • A new hybrid ensemble feature selection model for a machine learning-based post-COVID prediction system is proposed as an automatic feature cut-off rank identifier. • The associative rules, together with weak predictors, improve the classification quality. • The proposed three-layer stacking ensemble classification model uses the random forest model as an aggregator for weak generalization of repressor results. • Aging-related biomarkers, viz. CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ , CD22+ were examined to predict postCOVID rehabilitation duration. • The research offers predictive attributes that can be used to monitor the severity of the disease and forecast the rehabilitation duration. Further research will focus on increasing the data sample by adding information about new patients, refining the extended dataset model, and applying small data analysis approaches like inputdoubling using nonlinear kernels [47] or RBF-based input-doubling [48] to improve prediction accuracy and reliability",,,
"Organ and cell-specific biomarkers of Long-COVID identified with targeted proteomics and machine learning
","Background Survivors of acute COVID-19 often suffer prolonged, diffuse symptoms post-infection, referred to as “Long-COVID”. A lack of Long-COVID biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms limits effective diagnosis, treatment and disease surveillance. We performed targeted proteomics and machine learning analyses to identify novel blood biomarkers of Long-COVID.

Methods A case–control study comparing the expression of 2925 unique blood proteins in Long-COVID outpatients versus COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects. Targeted proteomics was accomplished with proximity extension assays, and machine learning was used to identify the most important proteins for identifying Long-COVID patients. Organ system and cell type expression patterns were identified with Natural Language Processing (NLP) of the UniProt Knowledgebase.

Results Machine learning analysis identified 119 relevant proteins for differentiating Long-COVID outpatients (Bonferonni corrected P < 0.01). Protein combinations were narrowed down to two optimal models, with nine and five proteins each, and with both having excellent sensitivity and specificity for Long-COVID status (AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). NLP expression analysis highlighted the diffuse organ system involvement in Long-COVID, as well as the involved cell types, including leukocytes and platelets, as key components associated with Long-COVID.

Conclusions Proteomic analysis of plasma from Long-COVID patients identified 119 highly relevant proteins and two optimal models with nine and five proteins, respectively. The identified proteins reflected widespread organ and cell type expression. Optimal protein models, as well as individual proteins, hold the potential for accurate diagnosis of Long-COVID and targeted therapeutics.
","In this study, we measured the expression of 2925 blood proteins using targeted proteomics for age- and sex-matched Long-COVID outpatients, acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients (Ward and ICU) and healthy control subjects. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified 119 important proteins that differentiate Long-COVID outpatients from other cohorts, indicating a unique protein profile. Two optimal models, with a subset of nine and five proteins, accurately differentiated Long-COVID patients from acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects (classification accuracy of 100%, AUC of 1.00, F1 1.00). Organ and cell type expressions were examined with NLP of the UniProt Knowledgebase.
Our patient cohorts were similar to those reported in earlier studies with regard to demographics, comorbidities and clinical presentation. The Long-COVID outpatients suffered diffuse symptoms across multiple organ systems, such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, anosmia and cognitive dysfunction (Carfì et al. 2020; Davis et al. 2021). With regards to acutely ill COVID-19 patients, they were also similar to those reported in earlier cohorts (Myers et al. 2020; Bhatraju, et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020), and demonstrated significant inflammatory and thrombotic mechanisms (Fraser et al. 2020a; Fraser et al. 2020b; Fraser et al. 2020c; Gill et al. 2020), as well as microvascular injury (Fraser et al. 2020d).
Our study identified 119 proteins that differentiated Long-COVID outpatients from acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects. Each of the 119 proteins was significantly different in Long-COVID outpatients, as compared to other cohorts, and had individual AUCs ranging from 0.91 to 1.00. The models with a reduced number of biomarkers were created to provide specific research targets for future studies assessing disease specificity, diagnostics and understanding of Long-COVID pathophysiology. The first optimal model contained nine proteins: CXCL5, AP3S2, MAX, PDLIM7, FRZB, EDAR, LTA4H, CRACR2A, and CXCL3. The optimal second model is a subset of the first with five proteins: CXCL5, AP3S2, MAX, PDLIM7, and FRZB. Each of the optimal models demonstrated excellent classification and AUC, as well as precision and recall. Each of the nine optimal proteins was significantly different in Long-COVID outpatient when compared pair-wise to the other cohorts. Of the nine proteins, eight had increased expression and one decreased. The functions of the optimal nine proteins varied widely and appropriately corroborated that Long-COVID is a multifaceted condition in which multiple systems are affected.
NLP, a subset of artificial intelligence, was used to identify organ and cell type expression patterns of the significant 119 proteins. Expert curated expression information from UniProt Knowledgebase was parsed using NLP to identify key cell types, organs, tissues, major tissue systems and anatomical systems. Parsed information from the latter four expression categories was combined to represent the organ system to which the molecules were being expressed within. Of the 119 proteins, 60 had organ system expression information and 44 had cell type expression information. Overall, other than the integumentary system, the reduced proteins are highly expressed in all other organ systems, corroborating again the multi-system symptom presentation in Long-COVID patients.
The digestive system had the highest number of significant proteins with altered expression. This finding was consistent with a significant gut biome change identified in Long-COVID patients when compared to both controls and recovered COVID-19 patients without Long-COVID symptoms (Liu et al. 2022). Gastrointestinal and digestive symptoms, including vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, have been reported in Long-COVID patients (Groff et al. 2021; Huang et al. 2021). Mutations in AP3S2, one of the optimal five proteins, were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Kazakova, et al. 2017; Kooner et al. 2011; Mohlke and Boehnke 2015) and may be related to the hypothesized increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus due to COVID-19 (Rubino et al. 2020). CES3 played an important role in adipocyte differentiation and promoted lipid storage (Dominguez et al. 2014). In CES3 knockout mice, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance improved (Wei et al. 2010). In animal models, VPS37A changed intracellular receptor localization such that overexpression of VPS37A resulted in decreased blood glucose levels (Sekar 2022) and in Long-COVID may be a protective effect to counteract the AP3S2 and CES3 overexpression. Overexpression of SRC is involved with colon cancer and often results in metastasis via its signalling pathways (Chen et al. 2014).
The lymphatic system appeared to be highly affected in Long-COVID as more than 50% of the 60 significant proteins had expression in lymphatic organs. Of the 44 proteins with cell type expression information, lymphocytes and leukocytes not yet determined were the two most common cell types. Consistent with protein expression, autopsies of critically ill COVID-19 patients have revealed changes to the structure of the spleen and lymph nodes (Liu et al. 2020). CRACR2A and CXCL3 were both linked to immune cell activation and may indicate an ongoing immune response in Long-COVID outpatients. CRACR2A participated in T-cell activation and functional CRACR2A changes were linked to immunodeficiency disorders (Srikanth, et al. 2016; Wu, et al. 2021; Notarangelo et al. 2020). CXCL3 was linked to activating neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and lymphocytes (Laing and Secombes 2004). Three of the optimal nine proteins, CXCL5, LTA4H, and CXCL3, as well as CCL5, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, and CCL26 from the 119 proteins were pro-inflammatory (Laing and Secombes 2004; Mendez-Enriquez and García-Zepeda 2013; Fourie 2009; Chang et al. 1994; Larose et al. 2015; Soria and Ben-Baruch 2008; Ponath et al. 1996). CCL3 and CCL5 were reported previously to be elevated in Long-COVID patients (Patterson et al. 2021b). Several immune cell receptors were also a part of the top 119 proteins including CD226, CD84, CD40LG, and CD69. These inflammatory proteins were all significantly elevated in Long-COVID patients when compared to healthy control subjects and acutely ill COVID-19 subjects.
Long-COVID appeared to highly impact the nervous system with symptoms often including headaches, fatigue, and brain fog (Raveendran et al. 2021; Ortelli, et al. 2021). The NLP expression analysis showed that a large number of proteins are highly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in neurons. FRZB, AP3S2, and MAX were not only part of the optimal model, but were also linked to neurological conditions. FRZB was linked to defects in sensory innervation and spinal innervation (John et al. 2012), and decreased FRZB expression was associated with increased neuronal development (Jang et al. 2013). AP3S2 was a small chain of the Adaptor-related protein complex 3 (AP-3). AP-3 subunit defects lead to severe neurological abnormalities including neurodevelopmental delays, intellectual disability and seizures (Guardia et al. 2018). MAX mutations were associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma, a neural crest cell-based neuroendocrine tumour in the adrenal medulla (Comino-Méndez et al. 2011; Burnichon et al. 2012). Beyond the panel of optimal proteins, PLXNB3, APP, and BDNF were also associated with neurological conditions. PLXNB3, overexpressed in our Long-COVID outpatients has been previously linked to COVID-19 (Yaşar et al. 2021); it was shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth in mice and was also associated with verbal performance and brain white matter volume in humans (Hartwig et al. 2005; Rujescu et al. 2007). Overexpression of APP was either a protective response leading to cell health and growth, or detrimental with increased Aß accumulation and decreased dendritic synapses (Hoe et al. 2012; O'Brien and Wong 2011). BDNF upregulation was shown to increase proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (Lee et al. 2016).
Survivors of acute COVID-19 were at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disorders including ischemic heart disease, inflammatory heart disease, dysrhythmias, and thrombotic disorders (Xie et al. 2022). Vascular endothelial injury, angiogenesis and thrombosis were associated with acute COVID-19 pathophysiology (Ackermann, et al. 2020; Fraser et al. 2020e). Similarly, coagulation and inflammation were associated with Long COVID (Nalbandian et al. 2021; Pretorius, et al. 2021). We previously reported significant elevations in 14 vascular transformation biomarkers, including ANGPT1 and SELP, which are also a part of the top 119 proteins in this study (Patel et al. 2022). ANGPT1 has vascular protective effects while ANGPTL2 promoted angiogenesis (Thorin-Trescases and Thorin 2014; Brindle et al. 2006); however, in Long-COVID subjects, the ANGPT1/ANGPT2 ratio is dramatically increased indicating that the angiopoietin system is associated with vascular protection. Overexpression of PEAR1 was associated with decreased proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells further corroborating active vascular protection (Zhan et al. 2020). Several pro-coagulation factors were in the top 119 proteins including GP5, GP6, and STX8 (Moog et al. 2001; Golebiewska et al. 2015). GP5 and GP6 are involved in platelet adhesion and aggregation (Moog et al. 2001; Veninga et al. 2022) and STX8 is involved in platelet granule secretion, aggregation and thrombus stability (Golebiewska et al. 2015). Overexpression of GP6 was linked to large, reactive juvenile platelets (Veninga et al. 2022) and surface presentation of GP6-dimers is linked to thrombotic disorders (Induruwa et al. 2022). CASP2, part of the top 119 proteins, has previously been identified to be upregulated in COVID-19 and cardiomyopathy (Lee et al. 2021). Overall, Long-COVID pathophysiology may show active vascular protection or healing, as well as increased coagulation.
Long-COVID subjects often report prolonged respiratory symptoms with the most common being dyspnea (Pinto et al. 2022). Several of the 119 top proteins were associated with the respiratory system including EDAR, CCL17, EREG, GTPBP2, and DRG2. EDAR was previously identified to be altered in COVID-19 patients with lung epithelium injury (D’Agnillo, et al. 2021). Elevated CCL17 is associated with various pulmonary conditions including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma and COPD and cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation (Yogo et al. 2009; Machida et al. 2022; Staples et al. 2012). CCL17 was also noted to be an important biomarker for eosinophilic disorders including differentiating eosinophilic pneumonia from acute lung injury (Miyazaki et al. 2007; Catherine and Roufosse 2021). EREG was involved in cell proliferation and differentiation of airway epithelial cells (Riese and Cullum 2014). Overexpression of EREG, GTPBP2, and DRG2 was linked to tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer (Jie et al. 2021; Sunaga et al. 2008; Hong et al. 2018). FRZB is involved in the WNT/ ß-catenin pathway and serves as a WNT antagonist (Dale 1998). The WNT/ß-catenin pathway has been linked to various conditions including sepsis and inflammation, and was hypothesized to be involved in COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (Nusse and Clevers 2017; Zhang et al. 2021b; Satu et al. 2021). Increased FRZB was observed in acutely ill severe COVID-19 (Teng et al. 2021), but depressed in our Long-COVID outpatients.
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry via spike protein binding, and the ACE2 receptor is a critical component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) that is involved in renal, vascular, and myocardial functions (Martínez-Salazar et al. 2022). Downregulation of the ACE2 receptor during acute infection may lead to RAAS dysregulation, including electrolyte, cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction in Long-COVID (Sui et al. 2021; Lei et al. 2021; Pedrosa Maria et al. 2021; Cooper et al. 2021; Mandal et al. 2021). Reduced ACE2 function is linked to activation of the des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK)/bradykinin receptor B1 (BKB1R), potentially increasing neutrophil infiltration and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL5 (Abassi et al. 2021; Sodhi et al. 2018). This latter mechanism is consistent with the elevated CXCL5 in Long-COVID outpatients demonstrated by our proteomic study.
Our study has identified 119 key proteins and developed optimal models with nine and five proteins; however, our study has several limitations. First, we included an equal, yet conservative number of matched subjects within each group. Nonetheless, we ensured robust analysis via non-parametric statistics and conservative machine learning parameters. With regards to the latter, potential overfitting due to a nested feature selection was reduced by performing 10,000 repetitions of RFE, testing the optimal models’ performance on the unused test dataset, and conducting no hyper-parameter optimization. Second, our data showed altered protein expression in Long-COVID outpatients; however, we did not have longitudinal samples from each subject to determine protein changes over time with eventual normalization. Third, our analysis showcased models that differentiated Long-COVID outpatients from acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects; however, we cannot confirm these protein models were distinct from other pathologies. Cross-identity concerns can be mitigated by using a multiple protein combination, together with recognition of diffuse symptoms post-SAR-CoV-2 infection (PCR-positive acute illness or nucleocapsid antibody testing). A combined model would decrease the likelihood that other pathologies alter the same biomarkers, and in the same temporal manner, as Long-COVID. Fourth, previously collected healthy control samples were used to verify the absence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as our latest attempts to collect healthy control samples without previous infection or a recent vaccination were insufficient. While it is possible that some proteins in plasma can be susceptible to both storage duration and temperature, strict sample processing and storage protocols were followed. Lastly, the pre-trained NLP model cannot identify organ and cell type expression for proteins without information in UniProt Knowledgebase. Despite these caveats, and given the scarcity of knowledge on Long-COVID pathophysiology, our exploratory investigation provides valuable insights.

"Neuropsychological Predictors of Fatigue in Post-COVID Syndrome
","Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in several neurological disorders and has an important cognitive component. However, the relationship between self-reported cognitive fatigue and objective cognitive assessment results remains elusive. Patients with post-COVID syndrome often report fatigue and cognitive issues several months after the acute infection. We aimed to develop predictive models of fatigue using neuropsychological assessments to evaluate the relationship between cognitive fatigue and objective neuropsychological assessment results. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 113 patients with post-COVID syndrome, assessing them with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including standardized and computerized cognitive tests. Several machine learning algorithms were developed to predict MFIS scores (total score and cognitive fatigue score) based on neuropsychological test scores. MFIS showed moderate correlations only with the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test. Classification models obtained modest F1-scores for classification between fatigue and non-fatigued or between 3 or 4 degrees of fatigue severity. Regression models to estimate the MFIS score did not achieve adequate R2 metrics. Our study did not find reliable neuropsychological predictors of cognitive fatigue in the post-COVID syndrome. This has important implications for the interpretation of fatigue and cognitive assessment. Specifically, MFIS cognitive domain could not properly capture actual cognitive fatigue. In addition, our findings suggest different pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in post-COVID syndrome.","In this study, we evaluated a group of patients with PCS with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and a standardized scale for fatigue. The MFIS is one of the most commonly used tools for the assessment of fatigue in several conditions and has also been widely applied for the assessment of post-COVID-19 fatigue [36]. Interestingly, we only found moderate correlations between MFIS and Stroop test scores. The correlation was negative, meaning that higher fatigue severity is associated with poorer performance in the Stroop test. The correlation was slightly higher with MFIS-cognitive than MFIS-total score. The Stroop test is a measure of cognitive flexibility, selective attention, inhibition, and information processing speed [37], several of the processes linked to cognitive fatigue [38]. The other tests showed non-significant or low correlations, which suggests that these correlations are not clinically relevant.
We developed several machine learning algorithms in order to predict the presence of fatigue, several levels of fatigue severity, or the fatigue score, based on neuropsychological test scores. Despite using several algorithms with different approaches, the classification metrics obtained were considered low according to the F1-score and R2. In addition, three and four-classes models (which reflect different degrees of severity of fatigue) performed worse than binary classification (which means the presence or absence of clinically significant fatigue). This suggests that there are no substantial cognitive modifications over the different degrees of fatigue. To our knowledge, the relationship between cognitive performance and fatigue in PCS has only been explored in one other study [39]. In this case, the authors conducted a linear regression analysis and, even after including several scales of depression, anxiety, or apathy, the best model obtained an R2 of 0.418 for MFIS-cognitive, and the cognitive test included in the model (digit span backwards) explained a very low percentage of variance (partial correlation; r < −0.2). Overall, these results suggest that fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in PCS may present different pathophysiological mechanisms. Central fatigue has previously been associated with the activity of several brain regions and networks. Specifically, a recent study suggested the involvement of the striatum of the basal ganglia, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula [40]. Of these regions, the anterior cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula could have a more prominent role [38,41]. Most attentional/executive tests are more closely linked to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than to other regions, which may explain the low correlations with MFIS. One of the most noteworthy exceptions is the Stroop test, which has also been associated with the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in some studies of other disorders [42]. In addition, fatigue (and especially physical fatigue) in PCS may also have other mechanisms, such as immunological dysfunction [43], which could also explain the apparent discordance between subjective fatigue assessment and cognitive performance.
Although further research is probably needed to design and validate novel neuropsychological tasks that fully capture cognitive fatigue more ecologically, the extensive neuropsychological battery and wide variety of tests used in this study raise the fundamental debate about the capability of the cognitive subdomain of MFIS to detect actual cognitive fatigue. In this regard, other questionnaires or electrophysiological biomarkers have been suggested [44]. Reliable tools for the assessment of cognitive fatigue are needed for accurate diagnosis and follow-up and for evaluating the effect of new therapies in clinical trials. Previous studies have also used machine learning to analyze alternative fatigue detection methods based on new technologies. For instance, biological features extracted with EEG, electro-oculogram, or heart rate, and physical features such as yawning, drowsiness, or slow eye movements [45]. These approaches may be especially useful in the driving and occupational fields to reduce risks and improve workers’ health and well-being [46].
Our study has some limitations. Although our protocol included a wide range of cognitive tests, we cannot exclude the possibility that other cognitive tasks may improve prediction. For instance, some authors have used the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test as a measure of cognitive fatigue, especially in the field of multiple sclerosis [47,48], although they also observed no correlation with subjective fatigue [9,49,50]. In addition, we used the MFIS as a reference for the assessment of fatigue and cognitive fatigue. Other studies replicating these findings with other fatigue scales may be of interest [4].
In conclusion, our study did not identify reliable neuropsychological predictors of cognitive fatigue as determined by a subjective questionnaire. This may suggest that different pathophysiological mechanisms are associated with each disorder in PCS. Future studies using advanced neuroimaging protocols could be of interest to further disentangle the relationships between fatigue and cognitive function in the context of PCS.

"Post-COVID symptoms are associated with endotypes reflecting poor inflammatory and hemostatic modulation
","Introduction
Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection (“long COVID”) negatively affects almost half of COVID-19 survivors. Despite its prevalence, its pathophysiology is poorly understood, with multiple host systems likely affected. Here, we followed patients from hospital to discharge and used a systems-biology approach to identify mechanisms of long COVID.
Methods
RNA-seq was performed on whole blood collected early in hospital and 4-12 weeks after discharge from 24 adult COVID-19 patients (10 reported post-COVID symptoms after discharge). Differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and machine learning methods were used to identify underlying mechanisms for post-COVID symptom development.
Results
Compared to patients with post-COVID symptoms, patients without post-COVID symptoms had larger temporal gene expression changes associated with downregulation of inflammatory and coagulation genes over time. Patients could also be separated into three patient endotypes with differing mechanistic trajectories, which was validated in another published patient cohort. The “Resolved” endotype (lowest rate of post-COVID symptoms) had robust inflammatory and hemostatic responses in hospital that resolved after discharge. Conversely, the inflammatory/hemostatic responses of “Suppressive” and “Unresolved” endotypes (higher rates of patients with post-COVID symptoms) were persistently dampened and activated, respectively. These endotypes were accurately defined by specific blood gene expression signatures (6-7 genes) for potential clinical stratification.

","To better understand the pathophysiology underlying persistent post-COVID symptoms, gene expression differences were analyzed by comparing COVID-19 survivors who reported having persistent symptoms or not 4-12 weeks after discharge. Interestingly, cross-sectional comparison of patients with and without symptoms at follow-up and in hospital yielded almost no DE genes ( Figures S1D, E ), which was likely primarily related to the presence of three gene expression clusters, or endotypes, as well as other confounders contributing to heterogeneity that confounded direct comparisons.
In contrast, trajectory analysis, which accounts for individual factors including genetics, demographics, diet, microbiome, and age, highlighted how patients with and without post-COVID symptoms differed over time. Asymptomatic patients at follow-up showed massive gene expression changes related in part to a decrease, relative to their time in hospital, in clotting pathways and inflammation (Figures 1A, C). These are two key processes that have been highlighted to play a role in acute COVID-19 pathogenesis (50) and potentially in long COVID. In addition, there was an increase in the activity of adaptive immunity pathways, which may be reflective of a recovering adaptive immune response, since decreased adaptive immunity is also associated with poor outcomes in acute COVID-19 (54). The lack of these changes in symptomatic patients (Figure 1C) indirectly suggested that these processes may stay dysregulated in these patients and might potentially contribute to the development of persistent symptoms. Individual studies have indeed indicated persistent T cell functional deficits (55–57), inflammation (15, 16), and clotting abnormalities (23) in patients with post-COVID symptoms but have not looked at this issue in a temporal manner based on whole blood gene expression described in this study.
As an alternative strategy to investigating the impact of heterogeneity, based on underlying disease processes, unsupervised machine learning was performed to separate patients based on gene expression differences (i.e., mechanistic endotypes), rather than the presence or absence of symptoms. Endotypes have been used to study heterogeneity in both sepsis and COVID-19 (41) and were proposed to be present based on clinical/disease features in a long-COVID cohort (49). Here, patients were separated into three endotypes, based on mechanistically-linked gene expression differences. Each endotype had substantially varying proportions of post-COVID symptoms: Resolved (almost all patients were asymptomatic), Suppressive (almost all patients were symptomatic), and Unresolved (some symptomatic patients) (Figure 2A; Table 2), with specific gene expression biomarkers for each (Figure 4) that could distinguish endotypes with high and low rates of post-COVID symptoms; in contrast, clinical risk factors such as sex and smoking failed to distinguish endotypes in this cohort (Table 1).
Two key pathway groups stood out as differentiating the three endotypes: inflammatory (e.g., interleukin, interferon) and hemostasis (e.g., platelet degranulation) pathways (Figure 2B). The Resolved endotype had elevated expression of genes involved in inflammation and hemostasis pathways that decreased by discharge, suggesting resolution of these processes. The Suppressive endotype had low expression of inflammation and hemostasis genes in hospital and at follow-up, while the Unresolved endotype had high expression of these genes both in hospital and at follow-up. Overall, these comparisons suggested that proper initiation and then resolution of such responses (Resolved endotype) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of developing post-COVID sequelae, while failure to modulate these responses (Suppressive and Unresolved endotypes) was associated with development of these symptoms. Intriguingly, the Resolved endotype had the lowest rates of systemic corticosteroid use when hospitalized, with approximately half (41.7%) receiving corticosteroids compared to almost all patients in the other endotypes (85.7% and 100%) (Table 2), which could be an avenue of further investigation. Exogenous steroids can suppress endogenous steroid production, which might be occurring in the Suppressive and Unresolved endotypes, disrupting immune function, and low endogenous steroid levels have been documented in patients with post-COVID symptoms in another cohort (49). Use of such corticosteroids in-hospital could potentially interfere with mounting and resolving an appropriate immune response during COVID-19 and might increase the risk of persistent symptoms after discharge.
The mechanistic differences between the three endotypes (that were recapitulated in a validation dataset, Figure S6B ), suggested different pathophysiological reasons underlying the presence or absence of symptoms. Persistently low immune responses in the Suppressive endotype may impede clearance of the virus or enhance susceptibility to other infections or reactivation of latent infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, all of which may contribute to symptoms (22, 49). The increase in regulatory T cells may be contributing to the continually suppressed immune response observed in this endotype (Figure 2C). Low hemostatic function has also been associated with patients referred to a long-COVID clinic (24). Conversely, maintaining a high inflammatory and hemostatic response even after discharge is also likely to be detrimental, as seen in the Unresolved endotype (in which 40% or patients were symptomatic after discharge), potentially due to sustained autoimmune or inflammatory damage (18, 49), as well as microclot formation (23). The enrichment of interferon signaling pathways in the Unresolved endotype at follow-up (Figure 3) may also suggest ongoing viral infection as well. Overall, these hypotheses should be investigated further by analyzing the presence of viral RNA, auto-antibodies, and immune markers in follow-up patients in conjunction with gene expression in a future, larger study.
There are some limitations to this study. These findings are from a small cohort, in part due to logistic difficulties in obtaining high numbers of follow-up patients early in the pandemic, although we also observed the new endotypes in another public dataset. These patients were also unvaccinated and infected with earlier COVID-19 variants, thus future studies could evaluate these endotypes in vaccinated populations infected by current variants. Symptoms were self-reported, which could potentially add a degree of subjectivity to the analysis; this was difficult to mitigate for subjective symptoms such as fatigue. In addition, further subgrouping of patients based on specific symptoms in this cohort was not feasible due to the sample size, which is why patients were only separated into those with and without post-COVID symptoms. A larger future cohort might further elucidate whether there are specific trajectories associated with distinct inflammatory and coagulation pathways. Lastly, this analysis was performed on whole blood, and therefore symptoms that were localized to the brain, lung, or muscle, might not be easily detected in the blood. Nevertheless, a simple blood test is more convenient and clinically safer than an invasive tissue biopsy. Thus, the findings in this study can facilitate the development of a clinical gene biomarker panel (e.g., further clinical validation with quantitative real-time PCR) with the gene expression signatures for each endotype identified in the study (Figure 4) to better understand and potentially treat the underlying personalized pathophysiology of each patient. Future studies could investigate these endotypes at even later time points.
In conclusion, failure to modulate inflammatory and hemostatic pathways was associated with a higher rate of development of persistent symptoms after hospitalization for a COVID-19 lung infection, and vice versa, suggesting that a dynamic immune and coagulation system was protective against “long COVID”. Modulating these processes in patients suffering from persistent post-COVID symptoms, guided by gene expression signatures to determine whether to dampen a persistently activated response or boost a lacklustre response to restore homeostasis, may be essential to ensure that these patients can return to a better quality of life after COVID-19.

"Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Determine the Post-COVID State of a Person by Their Rhythmogram
","This study introduces a novel method for detecting the post-COVID state using ECG data. By leveraging a convolutional neural network, we identify “cardiospikes” present in the ECG data of individuals who have experienced a COVID-19 infection. With a test sample, we achieve an 87 percent accuracy in detecting these cardiospikes. Importantly, our research demonstrates that these observed cardiospikes are not artifacts of hardware–software signal distortions, but rather possess an inherent nature, indicating their potential as markers for COVID-specific modes of heart rhythm regulation. Additionally, we conduct blood parameter measurements on recovered COVID-19 patients and construct corresponding profiles. These findings contribute to the field of remote screening using mobile devices and heart rate telemetry for diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19.
","It is well known that disturbances in the work of the cardiovascular system and its regulation lead not only to the appearance of various heart rhythm distortions, but also to changes in the basic characteristics of the heart rate, such as heart rate variability (HRV). HRV analysis is rarely used to diagnose specific diseases. The only HRV analysis proposed by the American Heart Association for diagnostic use is the observation that low 24 h HRV in diabetes mellitus is an early sign of diabetic neuropathy [69].
The main goal of analyzing a patient’s HRV is to assess their functional state in order to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, assess the severity of the disease, predict the risk of sudden death or dangerous complications in various diseases, and so on. The interest in HRV is primarily due to the property of the heart rhythm over time, where rigidity of a patient’s heart rhythm indicates a deterioration in their condition. R. Baevsky explains this property of the rhythm with the concept of the relationship between the adaptive capabilities of the human body and its HRV: low HRV reflects the poor adaptability of the cardiovascular system to random or permanent effects on the body [70].
In this regard, the following requirement is usually put forward for the quantitative parameters of HRV: when the patient’s condition worsens, the statistical parameters of HRV should decrease, and when the condition improves, they should increase. Since the 1960s, HRV has been studied at rest for short (up to 5 min) time intervals, while meeting strict requirements for rhythm stationarity [71].
In this case, two main characteristics of the rhythm are used: the cardiorhythmogram of rest and the magnitude of the accompanying arrhythmia. As significant parameters of HRV, both the characteristics of the histogram of the distribution of RR intervals and derivatives of these characteristics are used, including the parameters of variational pulsometry, as well as the spectral characteristics of the sequence of RR intervals. Numerous studies have shown that the deterioration of the patient’s functional state correlates with both a decrease in RR at rest and a decrease in the severity of the accompanying arrhythmia. Thus, RR at rest of 700 ms and above significantly increases the risk of cardiac death in various cardiovascular diseases, and rigidity of the resting rhythm, regardless of the value of RR, significantly increases the risk of cardiac death in myocardial infarction [72].
Since the 1980s, commercial Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring systems have been available. This made it possible to start active study of HRV over long (mainly daily) periods of time. The study of HRV in patients with various cardiovascular and other pathologies has been carried out, and many works have been published on the analysis of HRV over long periods of time. In the vast majority of these works, quantitative parameters of HRV were used, which are used in the analysis of a stationary rhythm over short periods of time [47].
It is obvious that the use of these parameters for long periods of time was effective only in the analysis of stationary (rigid or close to rigid) rhythms characterizing a very poor functional state of a person [73]. At the same time, periodic local (3–6 intervals) fluctuations in the duration of RR intervals remained outside the focus of researchers’ interests for a long time. A positive example of an in-depth clinical study of the significance of local fluctuations in the duration of RR intervals is the work of [74].
In a study by Asarcikli [75], autonomic function in the post-COVID period was examined using HRV analysis. Comparing 24 h ECG recordings of post-COVID patients with healthy controls revealed significant differences in HRV scores. Time and frequency domain indices, including SDNN 24 h, RMSSD, high frequency, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio, were higher in post-COVID patients. The prevalence of SDNN > 60 ms and RMSSD > 40 ms was also higher among post-COVID patients. Logistic regression models supported the presence of a parasympathetic overtone in post-COVID patients, independent of covariates. These findings suggest autonomic imbalance as a potential explanation for persistent orthostatic symptoms in the post-COVID period.
The processing of medical data is essential in terms of making subsequent diagnoses and prescribing treatment or rehabilitation measures. Existing clinical systems for analyzing ECG data are based on the Two-Moving-Average algorithm, which, as our study shows, smooths the signal in such a way that significant information for diagnosing the patient’s condition disappears. However, by employing alternative algorithms, such as Pan–Tompkins and Hamilton, in the calculation of rhythmograms from ECG data, it becomes possible to acquire a more comprehensive data description.
The progress in ECG data analysis methods and their integration into clinical data analysis systems has the potential to extend the existing diagnostic capabilities for diseases, leading to significant enhancements in patients’ quality of life. Furthermore, it can facilitate the development of mobile systems for diagnosing patients’ conditions, which is a crucial undertaking in the prevention and treatment of diseases with high rates of transmission and systemic impacts on the body.

Post-COVID-19 menstrual abnormalities and infertility: Repercussions of the pandemic,"While battling the life-threatening complications of COVID-19, its effect on the menstrual cycle and infertility has been somewhat ignored. This brief review aims on highlighting the importance of menstrual abnormalities being experienced during the post-COVID period and to make the clinicians aware about what to expect in regard of menstrual abnormalities by learning from various studies that have been conducted worldwide. This review article was written with systematic literature review with the help of data search machine such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar. A search strategy leads to the extraction of 160 related articles that after the removal of inappropriate and duplicate articles, 33 articles were selected for the review. To find other potentially relevant articles, the references of the extracted articles were thoroughly examined. The search was carried out using keywords including “COVID-19,” “Menstrual abnormalities,” and “Infertility.” Using OR and AND, the keywords mentioned above were combined and then utilized in the search box of the databases. Articles published from January 2020 to September 2021 were included in this study. It includes worldwide data ranging from studies done in China, India, Ireland, Turkey, Jordan, and Germany. During the post-COVID period, there is a significant alteration in the sex hormones of females infected by COVID-19 which may manifest as menstrual cycle abnormalities such as decreased cycle length or prolonged menstrual cycle bleeding. It may also manifest as infertility due to ovarian failure due to suppression of ovarian function COVID-19 a novel coronavirus which is presently a pandemic has affected the world in manner reminding the world of 1918 Spanish flu. However, while battling the deadly pandemic, the clinicians should also be aware of the repercussions of the effect this infection has on multiple organs such as ovarian suppression leading to infertility, oligomenorrhea, or menorrhagia.
","Menstrual changes reported post-COVID-19
It was found that post-COVID-19, there was an upsurge of menstrual abnormalities such as prolonged cycles and decreased volume of menstruation.[3] A few patients also reported to have shortened or disordered menstrual cycles as well as increased volume of menstruation.[4] It was found that menstrual changes were observed more commonly in patients of COVID-19 with systemic complications arising out of COVID.[5] This suggests that menstrual changes which are often neglected by the treating clinicians are more common to be seen in patients with multisystem dysfunction. Hence, there is massive underreporting of menstrual abnormalities which otherwise seems to be a very common problem associated with COVID-19.
Sex hormone changes in COVID-19
Assessment of sex hormones is often neglected in patients with COVID-19, however, it was found that some patients with COVID-19 had abnormal levels of sex hormones.[6] There was inappropriately high concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) seen in patients with COVID-19.[7] This points toward ovarian suppression which might be linked to COVID-19. When placed in stress, ovarian function is often suppressed to ensure normal functioning of other organ systems which are essential for life and amenorrhea has also been previously reported in acute diseases. This explains infertility and decreased menstruation in patients with COVID-19 which may be linked to ovarian suppression due to acute stress of COVID-19 infection and multiple organ dysfunction. This also supports the presence of menstrual changes in patients with more severe involvement of multiple organ systems which was clinically witnessed by various studies.
There has been documentation of difference in response to inflammation by different sex which can be attributed sex steroid hormones.[8] Age-related decrease in sex hormones is also associated with more severe COVID-19 infection which might be associated with higher mortality witnessed in the elderly with COVID-19. Sex hormones have shown to mitigate inflammatory response and thus the increase in sex hormones in COVID-19 can be a response to decrease the inflammation associated with cytokine storm. Hormone replacement therapy has thus been studies as a potential therapy to mitigate inflammation in COVID-19.
Impact of COVID-19 on ovarian reserve
To determine the effect of COVID-19 on ovarian reserve the patients have been tested in various studies for anti mulleruan hormone levels. Granulosa cells of small antral and preantral ovarian follicles are responsible for secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and it's deficiency directly depicts decreased ovarian reserve.[9] Levels of anti-Mullerian hormone are not affected by the menstrual cycle, exogenous sex hormones, or pregnancy. Deficiency of anti-Mullerian hormone detected in post-COVID period depicts the decreased ovarian reserve due to COVID-19 which might ultimately result in infertility. Another school of thought is that there is presence of angiotensin convertase enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor on the ovarian follicles.[10] SARS-CoV-2 exerts it's effect through modulation of these ACE 2 receptors which were earlier thought to be present only in the pulmonary system. However, the presence of ACE 2 receptors on ovarian follicles has now clearly been established and expression of ACE 2 receptors on the ovarian follicles is essential for maturation of these follicles along with ovulation, modulation of luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and it also influences the regular changes which are observed in endometrial tissue and embryo development.[5] ACE2 mRNA transcripts have been detected in the ovaries of women of reproductive age group as well as postmenopausal women.
ACE2 receptor has been found in stroma and granulosa cells as well as oocytes in immature rat ovaries, the expression of which is enhanced in antral and preovulatory follicles.[11] It's presence in the antral follicle might explain the reduced anti-Mullerian hormone in post-COVID patients. ACE 2 receptors are also expressed on the vagina, placenta, and uterus. This explains another postulate of reduced ovarian reserve where SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the ovarian follicles using these ACE 2 receptors leading to infertility and various menstrual abnormalities.
Effect of COVID-19 on the endometrium
Angiotensin II plays a dual role in the vascular bed and regeneration of the endometrium and it also initiates menstruation through vasoconstriction of spiral artery.[12] The balance between angiotensin II and Ang (1–7) could regulate the myometrium activity and regeneration of endometrium.[13] Furthermore, angiotensin II increases the proliferation of epithelial cells of the uterus and stroma cells and enhances the fibrosis of endometrium.
Therefore, angiotensin II is essential for regular menstrual cycles and alteration in the receptors of angiotensin II may thus lead to dysfunctional uterine bleeding and hyperplasia of the endometrium.[14] Furthermore, extensive expression of ACE 2 might be correlated with metastasis and prognosis of endometrial carcinoma.[15] Therefore, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE 2 receptors present in the endometrium may be a prime reason for menstrual abnormalities being witnessed after COVID-19 infection.
Role of inflammatory cytokines
There is a role of immune dysregulation in COVID-19. The immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is shown to involve all the components of immune system that combined together appear to be responsible for elimination of the virus and recovery from the infection.[16] However, such strong immune responses are responsible for the disease's progression to an even more severe as well as lethal process. Interleukin-6 is emerging as a key cytokine involved in the inflammatory response seen in COVID-19.[17] Interleukin-6 along with other cytokines such as interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha triggers a procoagulant state which is unfavorable for blastocyst or fetus in a normal uterus of human.[18,19] This might explain another reason for the infertility associated with COVID-19.
Role of basigin receptor
Besides, ACE 2 receptor another receptor responsible for SARS-CoV-2 invasion is basigin (BSG) receptor.[20] This basigin receptor mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. Basigin receptor is expressed in the uterus as well as granulosa and stroma cells of the ovary.[21] Basigin receptor normally plays a crucial role in the development of follicles, formation of corpus luteum, and implantation of the embryo. Thus, modulation of this receptor in COVID-19 might contribute to infertility.
Effect of COVID-19 of hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis
The hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis plays a crucial role in regulation of the human reproductive system. The anterior portion of pituitary is responsible for the production of LH and FSH, and the gonads are responsible for the production of estrogen and testosterone; the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis regulates female menstrual cycle. The positive loop of feedback between estrogen and LH is responsible to prepare the follicles in the ovary for ovulation and to prepare the uterus for implantation.
The hypothalamus and pituitary both have ACE 2 receptors and can be sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection if the virus is able to invade the brain.[22] It is postulated in some studies that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the brain through the olfactory pathway where it enters the brain through cribriform plate which is porous.[23] The virus may then enter the hypothalamus as the blood–brain barrier is permeable in proximity of this structure. Furthermore, infection of the hypothalamus might result in hypophysitis which would also disturb the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis, thereby leading to menstrual abnormalities and infertility.[24]
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and lifestyle changes during the pandemic
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is also being reported in patients with COVID-19, there is chronic anovulation which is not due to any underlying cause but is associated with energy deficit, anxiety and mood disorders.[25] Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea has long-term consequences of health of the patients, leading to subfertility, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, and osteoporosis. There was a significant increase in incidence of missed periods which might be explained by functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to psychological distress and also increased amount of exercise.[26] Will these missed periods ultimately lead to chronic anovulation is yet to be determined as COVID-19 is a new infection and the long term effects of COVID-19 are yet unknown.
Women who earlier had a history of missed periods are more prone to have amenorrhea during the pandemic.[27] As many women have gained wright and have reported their diet to get worsen during the pandemic, this amenorrhea is not only related to stress but also to obesity and worsening of polycystic ovarian disease due to increase in body weight.
Premenstrual syndrome in COVID-19
Various patients with COVID-19 have reported worsening of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.[28] Premenstrual syndrome is reported more in women with high psychological stress.
Premenstrual syndrome can significantly affect patients health and is associated with impairment of various activities of daily life and mental health disorders such as anxiety, postnatal, and perimenopausal depression. Many patients with COVID-19 reported periods to be heavy and more painful with a significant difference than before COVID-19 infection.[29] Again, this can be attributed to increased level of stress and psychological distress along with low mood all of which are being witnessed during the pandemic. A few studies have also found patients to experience hypoactive sexual disorder where symptoms last for a period of more than 6 months and these symptoms are accompanied with distress.[30] Reduced sexual desire has been associated with depression and anxiety. The psychological impact of pandemic along with environmental factors has also contributed in inducing psychological distress precipitating premenstrual symptoms and a number of coping strategies have been tried for the same.[31,32]
Male infertility linked with COVID-19
The semen analysis of patients with COVID-19 did not show any viral RNA.[33] However, stress, anxiety, and other psychological factors may impact the sperm count in male patients who contract COVID-19. The presence of ACE 2 receptors on the testis can also be linked to a subfertility and decreased sperm count associated with COVID-19.[34,35] However, this requires further studies to verify.
Limitation and recommendation
A limitation of this review of literature remains the study selection phase. In this review, the studies published in English language were included and potentially relevant articles published in other languages could not be selected for review. Furthermore, certain articles on our topic which were not free to access and were costly to subscribe could not be included in our study.
We suggest regular screening of females of reproductive age group who contract COVID-19 infection so that they undergo regular follow-up and to report any kind of abnormalities in their menstrual cycles as there are a number of factors which influence the menstrual cycle as well as fertility post-COVID-19

"Prediction of muscular paralysis disease based on hybrid feature extraction with machine learning technique for COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients

","Many Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and post-COVID-19 patients experience muscle fatigues. Early detection of muscle fatigue and muscular paralysis helps in the diagnosis, prediction, and prevention of COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients. Nowadays, the biomedical and clinical domains widely used the electromyography (EMG) signal due to its ability to differentiate various neuromuscular diseases. In general, nerves or muscles and the spinal cord influence numerous neuromuscular disorders. The clinical examination plays a major role in early finding and diagnosis of these diseases; this research study focused on the prediction of muscular paralysis using EMG signals. Machine learning–based diagnosis of the diseases has been widely used due to its efficiency and the hybrid feature extraction (FE) methods with deep learning classifier are used for the muscular paralysis disease prediction. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is applied to decompose the EMG signal and reduce feature degradation. The proposed hybrid FE method consists of Yule-Walker, Burg’s method, Renyi entropy, mean absolute value, min-max voltage FE, and other 17 conventional features for prediction of muscular paralysis disease. The hybrid FE method has the advantage of extract the relevant features from the signals and the Relief-F feature selection (FS) method is applied to select the optimal relevant feature for the deep learning classifier. The University of California, Irvine (UCI), EMG-Lower Limb Dataset is used to determine the performance of the proposed classifier. The evaluation shows that the proposed hybrid FE method achieved 88% of precision, while the existing neural network (NN) achieved 65% of precision and the support vector machine (SVM) achieved 35% of precision on whole EMG signal.","When compared with CNN and NN, SVM provides poor performance of the input signals for prediction; i.e., SVM achieved only 35% of precision that are not influenced by the FS technique. Even though SVM performed well on semi-structured and unstructured data, it provides poor performance when the target class are overlapping. The NN achieved 65% of precision without Relief-F algorithm for final prediction, where it increased its performance nearly 3% when it is incorporated with a Relief-F algorithm. The reason is that it requires vast amount of data, i.e., more than thousands of data for training. The research study uses only limited amount of data as input for muscular paralysis disease prediction; therefore, CNN is implemented and achieved 85% of precision by using hybrid FE techniques. The CNN method has the advantage of instance-based learning and this method adaptive learn the data for classification. However, more features lead to poor performance on final classification, which requires optimal features. Therefore, Relief-F is implemented with CNN and achieved 88% of precision. The recall value of the proposed hybrid FE with CNN method is analyzed, as shown in Fig          The analysis shows that the proposed hybrid FE method has a higher recall value compared to the standard classifier. The NN achieved a lower recall value with and without FS than the other two techniques namely SVM and CNN; i.e., NN achieved nearly 75% to 77% of recall values. The SVM achieved 83% of recall values when FS technique is used for classification, where the same method degrades its performance to 2%, when the optimal features are not used for muscular paralysis prediction process. In this research study, the proposed hybrid FE method is used to extract the relevant features in the signal and achieved 81% recall value using CNN technique. However, more features lead to poor performance, and therefore, optimal features are selected by Relief-F algorithm and achieved 89% of recall value along with CNN technique. In addition, the CNN method has the advantage of adaptive learn the data for the classification. The error value of the proposed hybrid FE with CNN method is compared with NN and SVM, as shown in Figure",,,
"Development of criteria for cognitive dysfunction in post-COVID syndrome: the IC-CoDi-COVID approach
","Background
We aimed to develop objective criteria for cognitive dysfunction associated with the post-COVID syndrome.
Methods
Four hundred and four patients with post-COVID syndrome from two centers were evaluated with comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. The International Classification for Cognitive Disorders in Epilepsy (IC-CoDE) framework was adapted and implemented. A healthy control group of 145 participants and a complementary data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine-learning clustering algorithms were also used to evaluate the optimal classification and cutoff points.
Results
According to the developed criteria, 41.2% and 17.3% of the sample were classified as having at least one cognitive domain impaired using -1 and -1.5 standard deviations as cutoff points. Attention/processing speed was the most frequently impaired domain. There were no differences in base rates of cognitive impairment between the two centers. Clustering analysis revealed two clusters, although with an important overlap (silhouette index 0.18-0.19). Cognitive impairment was associated with younger age and lower education levels, but not hospitalization.
Conclusions
We propose a harmonization of the criteria to define and classify cognitive impairment in the post-COVID syndrome. These criteria may be extrapolated to other neuropsychological batteries and settings, contributing to the diagnosis of cognitive deficits after COVID-19 and facilitating multicenter studies to guide biomarker investigation and therapies.

","In this study, we adapted and applied to the post-COVID syndrome a classification system for cognitive phenotyping developed from other neurological disorders. This approach was applied to two large cohorts of patients with the post-COVID syndrome that underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment for clinical and research purposes. Importantly, the prevalence of cognitive deficits was very similar in both cohorts.",,,
"Hybrid model for early identification post-Covid-19 sequelae
","Artificial Intelligence techniques based on Machine Learning algorithms, Neural Networks and Naïve Bayes can optimise the diagnostic process of the SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19. The most significant help of these techniques is analysing data recorded by health professionals when treating patients with this disease. Health professionals' more specific focus is due to the reduction in the number of observable signs and symptoms, ranging from an acute respiratory condition to severe pneumonia, showing an efficient form of attribute engineering. It is important to note that the clinical diagnosis can vary from asymptomatic to extremely harsh conditions. About 80% of patients with Covid-19 may be asymptomatic or have few symptoms. Approximately 20% of the detected cases require hospital care because they have difficulty breathing, of which about 5% may require ventilatory support in the Intensive Care Unit. Also, the present study proposes a hybrid approach model, structured in the composition of Artificial Intelligence techniques, using Machine Learning algorithms, associated with multicriteria methods of decision support based on the Verbal Decision Analysis methodology, aiming at the discovery of knowledge, as well as exploring the predictive power of specific data in this study, to optimise the diagnostic models of Covid-19. Thus, the model will provide greater accuracy to the diagnosis sought through clinical observation.
","The post-COVID-19 syndrome is a set of symptoms that persisted in patients infected with SARSCOV-2, both in the manifestation of the disease in its mild/moderate form and its critical condition leading to hospitalisation for intensive long-term care infection (Irwin et al. 2018). Thus, patients surviving COVID-19 even after hospital discharge need immediate and long-term care related to psychomotor and social care. Persistent fatigue is one of the symptoms identified in the long term. When associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and diffuse myalgia, they are characterised as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which can be caused due to the febrile reaction and the immunodepression associated with viral status (Perrin et al. 2020). According to research carried out by Carfi et al. (2020), among the symptoms analysed by patients who were discharged from hospital after the cure of COVID-19, 53.1% of the people still revealed to have cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, in addition to fatigue and muscle weakness, due to prolonged hospitalisation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
As predictors of persistent pulmonary fibrosis are the constant high inflammatory load, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 324 and Body Mass Index (BMI) > 33 kg/m2 at hospital admission. The increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine (Interleukin-4) and macrophages are triggered by blocking the conversion of angiotensin-2 to angiotensin, inducing a pro-inflammatory state. The viral protein composed of a single RNA chain can be expressed in the bronchial and parenchymal pathways, corroborating lung injury and vascular endothelium, glial, renal, and enteric cells (Santana et al. 2021). The binding of the virus to the receptors of the Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2) favours viral penetration into cardiac cells, triggering sequelae and a high risk of thrombogenesis, which persist after infection SARS-CoV2 (Santana et al. 2021). Studies indicate a high prevalence of COVID-19 patients with damage to the cardiovascular system, such as acute cardiac injury of 7.2%, cardiogenic shock 8.7% and cardiac arrhythmia of 16.7%, which were caused due to the systemic inflammatory response by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease can lead to hypercoagulability, a high mortality rate and the need for cardiovascular protection during drug therapy for COVID-19 (Ferrari 2020).
After clinical discharge, due to the context of respiratory failure and immunological deficiency, hypoperfusion of the frontal lobe can be evidenced, and encephalopathy, which involves the rupture of the blood–brain barrier by the indirect invasion of the virus through cytokines (Mao et al. 2020). In addition to pulmonary involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2, other organs can suffer complications such as the development of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). Research infers those patients with dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affected by COVID-19 may develop severe immune dysregulation and exaggerated production of cytokines of acute infection, causing lymphopenia, anaemia, gastric or intestinal bleeding, bone and joint pain, myalgia, acidosis metabolic, malnutrition and alteration of the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus (Pecly et al. 2021).
Thus, the early detection of renal abnormalities is essential to ensure a better evolution of these patients during hospitalisation by planning excellent hemodynamic support when indicated and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs through medical risk judgment (Pecly et al. 2021). Another point to be discussed during the COVID-19 pandemic is the risk factor Diabetes Mellitus, a chronic disease capable of causing cellular and vascular metabolism changes. As a result, diabetic people are at high risk since hyperglycemia and insulin resistance that may be present in this public promote a more remarkable synthesis of glycation products, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress capable of stimulating the adhesion of inflammatory mediators and carry a higher risk of pulmonary infection (Marinho et al. 2021). According to World Health Organization (WHO), the initial signs and symptoms of the disease are similar to the flu condition. They can vary from each individual, manifested in mild form as pneumonia and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Most infected people experience headaches early in the disease, which can persist due to activation of the nociceptive system by the inflammatory cascade; cough; sore throat; diarrhoea; abdominal pain; nausea and vomiting. Hyposmia is also a common symptom in COVID-19 in the first eight days of the disease since the viral contamination of the olfactory bulb is considered the gateway of the virus to the Central Nervous System, reaching the olfactory cortex and structures of the diencephalon. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 invasion process can cause an axonal lesion, affecting the individual, even when cured, a change in sensitivity secondary to inflammatory microangiopathy of the nasal epithelium (Waheed et al. 2020)",,,
"Post-COVID Neuropsychiatric Complications in Children and Adolescents: a Study Design for Early Diagnosis and Treatment Using Innovative Technologies
","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the child and adolescent population, with long-term consequences for physical health, socio-psychological well-being, and cognitive development, which require further investigation. We herein describe a study design protocol for recognizing neuropsychiatric complications associated with pediatric COVID-19, and for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies grounded on the evidence-based findings.
Methods: The study includes two cohorts, each with 163 participants, aged from 7 to 18 years old, and matched by gender. One cohort consisted of individuals with a history of COVID-19, while the other group presents those without such a history. We undertake comprehensive assessments, including neuropsychiatric evaluations, blood tests, and validated questionnaires completed by parents/guardians and by the children themselves. The data analysis is based on machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in children and adolescents.

","Results: The first model is focused on a binary classification to distinguish participants with and without a history of COVID-19. The second model clusters significant indicators of clinical dynamics during the follow-up observation period, including the persistence of COVID-19 related somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms over time. The third model manages the predictors of discrete trajectories in the dynamics of post-COVID-19 states, tailored for personalized prediction modeling of affective, behavioral, cognitive, disturbances (academic/school performance), and somatic symptoms of the long COVID.
Conclusions: The current protocol outlines a comprehensive study design aiming to bring a better understanding of COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in a population of children and adolescents, and to create a mobile phone-based applications for the diagnosis and treatment of affective, cognitive, and behavioral conditions. The study will inform about the improved management of preventive and personalized care strategies for pediatric COVID-19 patients. Study results support the development of engaging and age-appropriate mobile technologies addressing the needs of this vulnerable population group.

"A Precise Method to Detect Post-COVID-19 Pulmonary Fibrosis Through Extreme Gradient Boosting
","The association of pulmonary fibrosis with COVID-19 patients has now been adequately acknowledged and caused a significant number of mortalities around the world. As automatic disease detection has now become a crucial assistant to clinicians to obtain fast and precise results, this study proposes an architecture based on an ensemble machine learning approach to detect COVID-19-associated pulmonary fibrosis. The paper discusses Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and its tuned hyper-parameters to optimize the performance for the prediction of severe COVID-19 patients who developed pulmonary fibrosis after 90 days of hospital discharge. A dataset comprising Electronic Health Record (EHR) and corresponding High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of chest of 1175 COVID-19 patients has been considered, which involves 725 pulmonary fibrosis cases and 450 normal lung cases. The experimental results achieved an accuracy of 98%, precision of 99% and sensitivity of 99%. The proposed model is the first in literature to help clinicians in keeping a record of severe COVID-19 cases for analyzing the risk of pulmonary fibrosis through EHRs and HRCT scans, leading to less chance of life-threatening conditions.","At the time of pandemic, a severe insufficiency of diagnostic resources has been reported, even in the developed part of world. Timely detection of diseases could result in better treatment and could save lives. EHR is the digital version of patient’s reports. It contains patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results. EHRs could easily be used to automate the diagnostic process as they are already in the digitized version. It can make the whole process efficient, fast and precise than other diagnostic methods. A classification study with 1175 High-resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scans has also been included, to add an additional analysis to the results acquired from EHRs. The progression of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 patients is a difficult classification problem that necessitates the application of a powerful optimization algorithm and an efficient feature extraction process. Treatment decisions, prognostication, and research into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis can all be aided by automated diagnosis. The work is primarily an application of Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm for detecting pulmonary fibrosis. The technical contribution includes statistical analysis of the dataset and hyperparameter tuning of the algorithm using grid search. The results attained were sufficient to develop a diagnostic tool for detecting pulmonary fibrosis. Effective pre-processing and statistical analysis have been implemented on the dataset to obtain consistent and uniform values.
The modified XGBoost approach was chosen for this study because it has outstanding scalability and a fast-running speed, making it an effective ML method. Furthermore, machine learning methods allow for the simultaneous assessment of several variables and their complex interactions, as well as nonlinearity in the development of predictive models. This strategy has been used to solve a variety of machine learning issues. XGBoost has been used to classify cancer patients, epilepsy patients, and to diagnose chronic renal disease in biomedical domains. The results suggest that utilizing our tuned XGBoost classification system, it is possible to discriminate between normal patients and fibrosed lung with high accuracy. Our proposed framework was found to have a maximum classification accuracy of 99 percent, suggesting the potential clinical utility of EHR and HRCT data to categorize pulmonary fibrosis lung patients. Tables 
Tables5

The SVM and Logistic Regression techniques performed poorly when compared to the other systems. Random Forest shows most near approximates to the proposed method’s recall and accuracy values. The proposed XGB system is capable of handling large data dimensions while avoiding overtraining. Though, there are few limitations present in the study. Due to the unavailability of dataset for post-COVID-19 prior to the onset date, the analysis of high-risk trajectory prediction could not be included in this study. The available dataset only includes test reports obtained after 90 days of hospital discharge. This is surely a work to be included in future scope. The suggested model could also be utilized with a large-scale dataset including people from various geographical areas and age groups. The model has the potential to be a trustworthy tool for automatic analysis to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis.

"Investigating brain cortical activity in patients with post-COVID-19 brain fog
","Brain fog is a kind of mental problem, similar to chronic fatigue syndrome, and appears about 3 months after the infection with COVID-19 and lasts up to 9 months. The maximum magnitude of the third wave of COVID-19 in Poland was in April 2021. The research referred here aimed at carrying out the investigation comprising the electrophysiological analysis of the patients who suffered from COVID-19 and had symptoms of brain fog (sub-cohort A), suffered from COVID-19 and did not have symptoms of brain fog (sub-cohort B), and the control group that had no COVID-19 and no symptoms (sub-cohort C). The aim of this article was to examine whether there are differences in the brain cortical activity of these three sub-cohorts and, if possible differentiate and classify them using the machine-learning tools. he dense array electroencephalographic amplifier with 256 electrodes was used for recordings. The event-related potentials were chosen as we expected to find the differences in the patients' responses to three different mental tasks arranged in the experiments commonly known in experimental psychology: face recognition, digit span, and task switching. These potentials were plotted for all three patients' sub-cohorts and all three experiments. The cross-correlation method was used to find differences, and, in fact, such differences manifested themselves in the shape of event-related potentials on the cognitive electrodes. The discussion of such differences will be presented; however, an explanation of such differences would require the recruitment of a much larger cohort. In the classification problem, the avalanche analysis for feature extractions from the resting state signal and linear discriminant analysis for classification were used. The differences between sub-cohorts in such signals were expected to be found. Machine-learning tools were used, as finding the differences with eyes seemed impossible. Indeed, the A&B vs. C, B&C vs. A, A vs. B, A vs. C, and B vs. C classification tasks were performed, and the efficiency of around 60–70% was achieved. In future, probably there will be pandemics again due to the imbalance in the natural environment, resulting in the decreasing number of species, temperature increase, and climate change-generated migrations. The research can help to predict brain fog after the COVID-19 recovery and prepare the patients for better convalescence. Shortening the time of brain fog recovery will be beneficial not only for the patients but also for social conditions.","In the post-COVID-19 era, there is a wide variety of problems to solve in all areas of the global economy. The mental health of society will be one of the most important issues to address in the scientific effort. The main challenge of the reported research was to find differences in the ERP and resting state signal possible to be distinguished either by the cross-correlation or amplitude analysis or using classifiers.
Having developed models and classifiers as mentioned in Tadeusiewicz (2015) and Salankar et al. (2022), in future it may be possible to predict the probability of brain fog episodes in patients that have recovered < 2 months before the first brain fog symptoms, which can help doctors to prepare better therapy and brain fog prevention paths. Such an approach requires, however, additional self-arranged tests carried out by volunteers for finding COVID-19 antibodies and are not predicted to be obligatory for this research. In the next step, this can lead to a wide range of innovations and a new kind of therapies researched, invented, and introduced in the post-pandemic reality, including the Industry 4.0 (Rojek et al., 2020a) approach and 3D printing of therapeutic toys or tools (Rojek et al., 2020b) to increase the comfort of life in future patients, thus making the research presented herein justified.
This is the first article in the series planned to be published in connection with the greater project realization. In the future, we will apply the source localization techniques in order to find differences in the geodesic activity of the cortex between sub-cohorts. As this is only the initial stage of the research, we plan and hope to get better insight into the brain fog phenomena providing a better understanding that will result in a better diagnosis and therapy planning toward faster and full recovery as future pandemics are predicted to come in the next decades.
Global warming and climate change together with the decreasing number of species and intensive migrations support the development of new viruses and some of them probably will require future lockdowns and similar COVID-19 commonly known restrictions. That is why the outcome of the research was our motivation for finding a methodology that will allow predicting brain fog proneness on time, thus improving the comfort of the life of future patients.

"The Development of a Chatbot Technology to Disseminate Post-COVID-19 Information: Descriptive Implementation Study
","Background: Post-COVID-19, or long COVID, has now affected millions of individuals, resulting in fatigue, neurocognitive symptoms, and an impact on daily life. The uncertainty of knowledge around this condition, including its overall prevalence, pathophysiology, and management, along with the growing numbers of affected individuals, has created an essential need for information and disease management. This has become even more critical in a time of abundant online misinformation and potential misleading of patients and health care professionals.
Objective: The RAFAEL platform is an ecosystem created to address the information about and management of post-COVID-19, integrating online information, webinars, and chatbot technology to answer a large number of individuals in a time- and resource-limited setting. This paper describes the development and deployment of the RAFAEL platform and chatbot in addressing post-COVID-19 in children and adults.
Methods: The RAFAEL study took place in Geneva, Switzerland. The RAFAEL platform and chatbot were made available online, and all users were considered participants of this study. The development phase started in December 2020 and included developing the concept, the backend, and the frontend, as well as beta testing. The specific strategy behind the RAFAEL chatbot balanced an accessible interactive approach with medical safety, aiming to relay correct and verified information for the management of post-COVID-19. Development was followed by deployment with the establishment of partnerships and communication strategies in the French-speaking world. The use of the chatbot and the answers provided were continuously monitored by community moderators and health care professionals, creating a safe fallback for users.
Results: To date, the RAFAEL chatbot has had 30,488 interactions, with an 79.6% (6417/8061) matching rate and a 73.2% (n=1795) positive feedback rate out of the 2451 users who provided feedback. Overall, 5807 unique users interacted with the chatbot, with 5.1 interactions per user, on average, and 8061 stories triggered. The use of the RAFAEL chatbot and platform was additionally driven by the monthly thematic webinars as well as communication campaigns, with an average of 250 participants at each webinar. User queries included questions about post-COVID-19 symptoms (n=5612, 69.2%), of which fatigue was the most predominant query (n=1255, 22.4%) in symptoms-related stories. Additional queries included questions about consultations (n=598, 7.4%), treatment (n=527, 6.5%), and general information (n=510, 6.3%).
Conclusions: The RAFAEL chatbot is, to the best of our knowledge, the first chatbot developed to address post-COVID-19 in children and adults. Its innovation lies in the use of a scalable tool to disseminate verified information in a time- and resource-limited environment. Additionally, the use of machine learning could help professionals gain knowledge about a new condition, while concomitantly addressing patients' concerns. Lessons learned from the RAFAEL chatbot will further encourage a participative approach to learning and could potentially be applied to other chronic conditions.
","The RAFAEL chatbot and platform are an innovative and accurate information dissemination and learning tool addressing population concerns on post–COVID-19 in children and adults. The RAFAEL chatbot considers medical safety in applying this technology and makes users aware that the tool is not a medical consultation, while providing them with accurate and up-to-date information. Community engagement, communication, and partnerships were essential tools in driving traffic and use. Preliminary results showed that users in Geneva and the French-speaking world were interested in this type of technology to address their concerns and seek answers. Users were also satisfied with the answers given and the technology used, with high matching and satisfaction rates.
The RAFAEL chatbot provides reliable and accurate information. The fact that the RAFAEL chatbot builds on the ongoing experience of the CoviCare research group [2,9,11], the post–COVID-19 pediatric and adult consultations [14,15] at the Geneva University Hospitals, and the partnerships with patients, the community, and partner institutions has been key in predefining triggers, algorithms, and adequate responses. Its use has been promoted by the need in the population, the ease of accessibility via smartphones and computers, the ergonomic design, and the continuous monitoring of information in the initial phases to correct answers rapidly, when needed, and answer users via the contact form in the case of fallback. Its use has also been promoted by the accompanying communication campaigns, as information dissemination is not possible without an invitation and initial communication to use the technology provided. Communication remains 1 of the essential tools in establishing the success of any new technology and enables users and the bidirectional exchange to continue improving and feeding the database.
The use of machine learning could enable us to quickly and accurately deploy scalable, low-cost, and efficient tools in health care [31]. This could be particularly useful when trying to learn about a specific or new subject or disease [32]. In the context of post–COVID-19, this was a tool that was “just in time” [33], with several of the elements surrounding the disease and its impact still to be defined. When citizens and health care professionals faced the challenge of a lack of full understanding of a medical condition, chatbot technology helped deploy and disseminate all the information available in an accurate and easily accessible language, while underlining the learning approach of the chatbot and the fact that users were helping improve the knowledge base by providing information in a participative patient- and citizen-based approach. The chatbot technology was particularly useful in a time of limited resources, where health care professionals could not absorb the increasing demand during and between pandemic waves. This underlines the importance of developing and integrating helpful tools in the clinical care pathway so that patients have access to information, increased awareness, potential self-management strategies, and a decreased need for in-person consultation or in-person contact. Physicians and health care professionals should, however, be mindful of a potential digital divide, with the risk of inaccessibility for elderly patients or individuals without internet access or with difficulty in adopting these tools. The use of this large, scalable approach potentially reaching most of the population could help dedicate the more traditional resources (consultations, phone resources) to those without access to chatbot technology or with complex cases necessitating a more human or personalized approach. This could even eventually facilitate access to information for all groups as each approach will be tailored to specific needs and used in the correct and most efficient way.
Limitations
To date, the RAFAEL chatbot is still in its learning phase, and further evaluation is needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of this technology and apply it to other fields in medicine and chronic conditions. As the RAFAEL chatbot acts as a medical and information chatbot, its limitations lie in the anonymity and degree of privacy provided, also limiting its anthropomorphic capabilities when compared to a human being. To stay as anonymous and deidentifying as possible, the RAFAEL chatbot cannot be a substitute for a medical teleconsultation. Chatbots are, however, an asset when their use is well defined in the clinical care pathway, thus reducing the need for medical consultations and dedicating those to patients who require more specific information or management. The RAFAEL chatbot was designed in Switzerland and deployed worldwide in the francophone world, with its first version available in French. Eventually, 1 of the limitations of the RAFAEL chatbot will be its use in different languages and different cultural and societal contexts. The partnerships put in place help the RAFAEL platform overcome these challenges, and these elements are being considered when developing and expanding the RAFAEL chatbot.
Comparison With Other Work
Chatbots have been used in the acute COVID-19 response for risk assessment, surveillance, information dissemination, eligibility screening, and vaccination strategies [16]. Chatbots have also been used, even if not frequently to date, for chronic diseases [20]. The response in emergency and acute settings is usually different from the response in the case of chronic diseases, considering the patient population, the timeline, and the approach to management. Post–COVID-19 requires both an orientation and a coordination approach (large-scale, quick response) as well as a long-term approach addressing the social and medical impacts of a chronic condition on individuals and the community. Using the RAFAEL chatbot to address these challenges is a new and innovative way to be readily available with accurate information based on the evidence to date, with limited resources. With its self-learning ability, low cost, and minimally required maintenance and monitoring, chatbot technology could rely on a project management team (developers, communication experts, medical and social experts) and its expanding partnerships to answer a large numbers of users, therefore reducing in-person contact and reserving it for complex and specific situations.

"Heart rate variability as a marker of cardiovascular dysautonomia in post-COVID-19 syndrome using artificial intelligence
","Introduction
Cardiovascular dysautonomia comprising postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) is one of the presentations in COVID-19 recovered subjects. We aim to determine the prevalence of cardiovascular dysautonomia in post COVID-19 patients and to evaluate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to identify time domain heart rate variability (HRV) measures most suitable for short term ECG in these subjects.
Methods
This observational study enrolled 92 recently COVID-19 recovered subjects who underwent measurement of heart rate and blood pressure response to standing up from supine position and a 12-lead ECG recording for 60 s period during supine paced breathing. Using feature extraction, ECG features including those of HRV (RMSSD and SDNN) were obtained. An AI model was constructed with ShAP AI interpretability to determine time domain HRV features representing post COVID-19 recovered state. In addition, 120 healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls.
Results
Cardiovascular dysautonomia was present in 15.21% (OH:13.04%; POTS:2.17%). Patients with OH had significantly lower HRV and higher inflammatory markers. HRV (RMSSD) was significantly lower in post COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (13.9 ± 11.8 ms vs 19.9 ± 19.5 ms; P = 0.01) with inverse correlation between HRV and inflammatory markers. Multiple perceptron was best performing AI model with HRV(RMSSD) being the top time domain HRV feature distinguishing between COVID-19 recovered patients and healthy controls.
Conclusion
Present study showed that cardiovascular dysautonomia is common in COVID-19 recovered subjects with a significantly lower HRV compared to healthy controls. The AI model was able to distinguish between COVID-19 recovered patients and healthy controls.
","In the present study, cardiovascular dysautonomia was common (15.21%) in post COVID-19 recovered patients. This was reflected by lower HRV and presence of OH/POTS in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 infection. In addition, HRV(RMSSD) time domain measures can be considered as a marker for cardiovascular dysautonomia for short time ECG recording (60 s) as confirmed by the AI model ShAP interpretability algorithm, standard statistics, and permutation importance features ranking methods. Cardiovascular dysautonomia in the form of OH or POTS has been previously observed in active COVID-19 infection in some reports. However, there is no systematic study documenting the same in COVID-19 recovered subjects.3,7-10,20Autonomic symptoms in COVID-19 are often thought to be multifactorial with deconditioning, hypovolemia, hyperadrenergic state or viral/immune-mediated damage to the ANS playing an important role [3]. OH is the most common autonomic presentation in COVID-19 followed by POTS. The clinical presentation in POTS varies with most of the patients reporting orthostatic tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness or chronic fatigue [22]. Data regarding the occurrence of POTS following COVID-19 infection is markedly limited [7,10,23]. Though the exact mechanism for POTS in COVID-19 is still unclear, it has often been attributed to post-viral autoimmune response and damage to ANS [23,24]. In the present study, OH was the most common autonomic dysfunction observed in 12/92 (13.04%) patients. These patients had significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers and greater disease severity at the time of initial presentation. In our study, POTS was less frequent as compared to OH and was reported in 2/92 (2.17%) patients. An initial small study reported OH in 41% patients and POTS in 22% patients [20]. Another series of six patients documented OH in four while one patient had POTS [3].
HRV analysis from ECG has been used as a surrogate marker for cardiovascular dysautonomia. There is paucity of data regarding HRV in both active as well as in those recently recovered from COVID-19 [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. In the present study, we observed significantly lower HRV in COVID-19 recovered subjects as compared to healthy controls. This is the first study to characterise lower HRV according to disease severity and correlate it with inflammatory markers. Previous small studies have reported lower HRV in covid recovered patients [16,17]. However, these studies are limited by the design, lack of severity assessment and absence of correlation with inflammatory markers.
COVID-19 infection is characterized by an intense hyperinflammatory response known as “cytokine storm” with elevation of inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6 [25]. They have been reported as independent predictors of disease severity and worse outcomes in COVID-19 [25]. It has been previously established that ANS modulates the inflammatory response. Increased vagal responses has been associated with higher HRV and decreased inflammatory response through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [26]. Conversely, sympathetic overactivity, a finding observed in pro-inflammatory states is associated with lower HRV and poor outcomes. Low HRV and dysautonomia has been reported in other infectious states such as community acquired pneumonia, dengue and HIV [[27], [28], [29]]. There is inverse correlation between both short and long term HRV recordings and inflammatory markers including CRP [[30], [31], [32]]. In the present study, patients with increased levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 (r = −0.36) and CRP (r = −0.30) had a significant negative correlation with HRV. Further, patients recovering from moderate/severe COVID-19 had lower HRV and increased prevalence of OH reflecting higher cardiovascular dysautonomia in these patients.
AI using deep learning neural networks and data from wearable devices have been previously used as an effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 [33]. Both HR and HRV has been used previously in a convolutional neural network model with an AUC of 0.77 ± 0.018 for prediction of onset of COVID-19. They reported lower HRV with increased respiration and heart rate following onset of COVID-19 [34]. In our study, we used ML algorithms to confirm and select the best HRV time domain measure as a non-invasive biomarker for Post- COVID-19 cardiovascular dysautonomia. We found MLP classification as the top performing ML model in terms of its sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (87.5%) followed by AdaBoost Classifier (sensitivity 85.8% and Specificity 66.6%), Logistic Regression (sensitivity 77% and specificity 74%). MLP based permutation importance feature ranking showed HRV (RMSSD) is the top feature, followed by average RR and HR features to distinguishing between COVID-19 recovered patients and healthy controls. In the present study, HRV(RMSSD) time domain measure is the most relevant and accurate measure of ANS activity on a short-term ECG recording. In low- and middle-income countries, with a huge burden of COVID-19 recovered patients and having “post COVID-19 syndrome”, ML using low-cost ECG is a promising technique to identify those at risk of developing autonomic dysfunction.

"Investigating phenotypes of pulmonary COVID-19 recovery: A longitudinal observational prospective multicenter trial
","Background:
The optimal procedures to prevent, identify, monitor, and treat long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 are elusive. Here, we characterized the kinetics of respiratory and symptom recovery following COVID-19.
Methods:
We conducted a longitudinal, multicenter observational study in ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients recruited in early 2020 (n = 145). Pulmonary computed tomography (CT) and lung function (LF) readouts, symptom prevalence, and clinical and laboratory parameters were collected during acute COVID-19 and at 60, 100, and 180 days follow-up visits. Recovery kinetics and risk factors were investigated by logistic regression. Classification of clinical features and participants was accomplished by unsupervised and semi-supervised multiparameter clustering and machine learning.
Results:
At the 6-month follow-up, 49% of participants reported persistent symptoms. The frequency of structural lung CT abnormalities ranged from 18% in the mild outpatient cases to 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU) convalescents. Prevalence of impaired LF ranged from 14% in the mild outpatient cases to 50% in the ICU survivors. Incomplete radiological lung recovery was associated with increased anti-S1/S2 antibody titer, IL-6, and CRP levels at the early follow-up. We demonstrated that the risk of perturbed pulmonary recovery could be robustly estimated at early follow-up by clustering and machine learning classifiers employing solely non-CT and non-LF parameters.
Conclusions:
The severity of acute COVID-19 and protracted systemic inflammation is strongly linked to persistent structural and functional lung abnormality. Automated screening of multiparameter health record data may assist in the prediction of incomplete pulmonary recovery and optimize COVID-19 follow-up management.
","Herein, we prospectively evaluated trajectories of COVID-19 recovery in an observational cohort enrolled in the Austrian CovILD study (Sonnweber et al., 2021). Despite the resolution of symptoms and pulmonary abnormalities at the 6-month follow-up in a large fraction of the study participants, the recovery pace was substantially slower in the late convalescence when compared with the first three months after diagnosis (Sonnweber et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021a). Persistent symptoms and CT findings were detected in more than 40% and reduced LF in approximately one-third of the cohort, which is in line with recovery kinetics and signs of lung lesion chronicity reported by others (Caruso et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021b; Huang et al., 2021a; Faverio et al., 2021; Hellemons et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). By comparison, similar protracted pulmonary recovery was reported for SARS (Hui et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2004; Ngai et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2009) and non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (Wilcox et al., 2013; Masclans et al., 2011). Of note, treatment approaches for hospitalized patients in our cohorts and similar cohorts recruited at the pandemic onset in early 2020 (Caruso et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021b; Huang et al., 2021a; Faverio et al., 2021; Hellemons et al., 2021) differ significantly from the current standard of care for acute COVID-19, which includes early systemic steroid use and antiviral and various immunomodulatory medications. How improved standardized therapy and anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination affect the clinical and pulmonary recovery needs to be investigated.
In roughly half of our study participants with abnormal lung CT findings, and especially in those with low-grade structural abnormalities, no overt LF impairment at follow-up was discerned. Still, even subclinical lung alterations may bear the potential for clinically relevant progression of interstitial lung disease (Suliman et al., 2015; Hatabu et al., 2020) requiring systematic CT and LF monitoring. Conversely, symptom persistence was weakly associated with incomplete functional or structural pulmonary recovery.
Since PASC are found in as many as 10% of COVID-19 patients (Sahanic et al., 2021; Venkatesan, 2021; Sudre et al., 2021b), robust, resource-saving tools assessing the individual risk of pulmonary complications are urgently needed (Shah et al., 2021; Raghu and Wilson, 2020). Covariates and characteristics of severe acute COVID-19 such as male sex, age, and preexisting comorbidities, hospitalization, ventilation, and ICU stay were proposed as the risk factors of persistent pulmonary impairment (Sonnweber et al., 2021; Caruso et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021a; Faverio et al., 2021; Raghu and Wilson, 2020). However, their applicability in predicting complications of pulmonary recovery from mild or moderate COVID-19 is limited. Our results of univariate modeling, clustering, and ML prediction point towards a distinct long-term pulmonary risk phenotype that manifests during acute COVID-19 and early recovery and whose central components are protracted systemic (IL-6, CRP, anemia of inflammation) and microvascular inflammation (D-dimer), and strong humoral response (anti-S1/S2 IgG) demographic risk factors and comorbidities (Sonnweber et al., 2020). Hence, consecutive monitoring of systemic inflammatory parameters analogous to concepts of interstitial lung disease in autoimmune disorders (Khanna et al., 2020) and anti-S1/S2 antibody levels may improve identification of the individuals at risk of chronic pulmonary damage irrespective of the acute COVID-19 severity.
Clustering and ML have been employed for deep phenotyping and predicting acute and post-acute COVID-19 outcomes in multivariable data sets (Sahanic et al., 2021; Sudre et al., 2021a; Estiri et al., 2021; Demichev et al., 2021; Benito-León et al., 2021). We demonstrate that subsets of COVID-19 patients that significantly differ in the risk for long-term CT abnormalities may be defined by an easily accessible clinical parameter set available at the early post-COVID-19 assessment. This approach did not involve any CT or LF variables. Furthermore, the cluster classification correlated with the risk of long-term pulmonary abnormalities independently of the acute COVID-19 severity. Thus, these characteristics provide a useful tool for broad screening of convalescent populations, including individuals who experienced mild or moderate COVID-19.
We show that technically unrelated ML classifiers and their ensemble trained without CT and LF explanatory variables can predict lung CT findings independently of their grading at the 6-month follow-up with good specificity and sensitivity in the training collective and CV. By contrast, the more specific prediction of moderate-to-severe lung CT or risk estimation for LF deficits demonstrated a limited sensitivity. For the moderate-to-severe CT abnormalities, this can be primarily traced back to their low frequency resulting in a suboptimal classifier training, especially in CV. A substantial fraction of the participants (20.7%, n = 30) suffered from a preexisting respiratory condition (pulmonary disease, asthma, or COPD) likely paralleled by LF reduction, which possibly confounded the prediction of the post-COVID-19 LF deficits both by clustering and ML. Accumulating evidence suggests that post-acute COVID-19 symptoms are highly heterogeneous conditions with multiorgan, neurocognitive, and psychological manifestations (Sahanic et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2021; Davis et al., 2021), which may differ in risk factor constellations. This could explain why univariate modeling, clustering, and ML failed to estimate persistent symptom risk in our small study cohort. In general, the ML prediction quality may greatly benefit from a larger training data set and inclusion of additional explanatory variables such as cellular readouts of inflammation, in-depth medication, and broader acute symptom data. Nevertheless, the herein described cluster- and ML classifiers represent resource-effective tools that may assist in the screening of medical record data and identification of COVID-19 patients requiring systematic CT and LF monitoring. To facilitate the identification of patients at risk for protracted respiratory recovery and enable validation in an external collective, we implemented the clustering and prediction procedures in an open-source risk assessment application (https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/CovILD/).
Our study bears limitations primarily concerning the low sample size and the cross-sectional character of the trial. Because of the impaired availability of the patients and the prolonged inpatient rehabiliation, the 60- and 100-day follow-up visits in part showed a temporal overlap that may have impacted the accuracy of the longitudinal data. Missingness of the consecutive outcome variable record and the participant dropout, particularly of mild and moderate COVID-19 cases, may have also potentially confounded the participant clustering results and ML risk estimation for CT abnormalities and LF impairment since prolonged hospitalization was found to be a crucial cluster-defining and influential explanatory feature. Additionally, even though the reproducibility of the risk assessment algorithms was partially addressed by CV, cluster and ML classifiers call for verification in a larger, independent multicenter collective of COVID-19 convalescents.
In summary, in our CovILD study cohort we found a high frequency of CT and LF abnormalities and persistent symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, and a flattened recovery kinetics after 3 months post-COVID-19. Systematic risk modeling reveled a set of clinical variables linked to protracted pulmonary recovery apart from the severity of acute infection such as inflammatory markers, anti-S1/S2 IgG levels, multimorbidity, and male sex. We demonstrate that clustering and ML classifiers may help to identify individuals at risk of persistent lung lesions and to relocate medical resources to prevent long-term disability.

"Ecology and Machine Learning-Based Classification Models of Gut Microbiota and Inflammatory Markers May Evaluate the Effects of Probiotic Supplementation in Patients Recently Recovered from COVID-19
","Gut microbiota (GM) modulation can be investigated as possible solution to enhance recovery after COVID-19. An open-label, single-center, single-arm, pilot, interventional study was performed by enrolling twenty patients recently recovered from COVID-19 to investigate the role of a mixed probiotic, containing Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Streptococcus thermophilus, on gastrointestinal symptoms, local and systemic inflammation, intestinal barrier integrity and GM profile. Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, cytokines, inflammatory, gut permeability, and integrity markers were evaluated before (T0) and after 8 weeks (T1) of probiotic supplementation. GM profiling was based on 16S-rRNA targeted-metagenomics and QIIME 2.0, LEfSe and PICRUSt computational algorithms. Multiple machine learning (ML) models were trained to classify GM at T0 and T1. A statistically significant reduction of IL-6 (p < 0.001), TNF-α (p < 0.001) and IL-12RA (p < 0.02), citrulline (p value < 0.001) was reported at T1. GM global distribution and microbial biomarkers strictly reflected probiotic composition, with a general increase in Bifidobacteria at T1. Twelve unique KEGG orthologs were associated only to T0, including tetracycline resistance cassettes. ML classified the GM at T1 with 100% score at phylum level. Bifidobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium spp. inversely correlated to reduction of citrulline and inflammatory cytokines. Probiotic supplementation during post-COVID-19 may trigger anti-inflammatory effects though Bifidobacteria and related-metabolism enhancement.","COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed our lives. The impact of this disease goes beyond the effects that we see during the active phase, as long-COVID syndrome has been described, that could deeply impair health many months after COVID-19.
In this small pilot study, designed before that long-COVID [20,21] was described, we aimed to explore if the modulation of GM through probiotic supplementation could be able to contrast COVID-19-induced alterations in term of barrier integrity and immune response. Considering the pivotal role of gut barrier in maintaining local and systemic immune homeostasis, we explored GM ecological and functional inferred profiles, indirect markers of gut barrier integrity and systemic cytokine profile, together with clinical monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms pre- and post-probiotic supplementation.
Since the first outbreak in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone multiple variants over time. These variants have developed mutations capable of conferring higher transmissibility or antigenicity. However, the effect of probiotic supplementation demonstrated in this paper is not expected to change with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, as it is mostly related to probiotics contained in the mix rather than the interaction with the virus.
Interestingly, most patients at baseline (T0), which was a post-COVID free-of- supplementation timepoint, complained at least one gastrointestinal symptom, independently from the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms during COVID-19 active infection. Furthermore, considering that in our cohort patients with a previous known chronic gastrointestinal disease were excluded, this data could suggest a role of COVID-19 in triggering post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders [22,23,24,25].
Notwithstanding a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline, probiotic supplementation did not significantly improve symptoms at the end of treatment, probably because of the small sample size and the heterogeneity of reported gastrointestinal symptoms. However, looking at the single items of the GSRS questionnaire, some trends toward improvement could be highlighted even if not statistically significant, particularly regarding flatulence, constipation, and abdominal pain.
The presence of these gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline was not associated with active gastrointestinal inflammation as demonstrated by normal value of CRP and faecal calprotectin at baseline. Similarly, no gut barrier dysfunction was detected at baseline through zonulin evaluation, suggesting that after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, the epithelium in the gut rapidly repaired, consistently with previous reports [26,27,28].
However, the systemic activation of the immune response seemed to continue after clinical recovery, as the serum level of cytokines was high at baseline. In this scenario, the use of probiotic supplementation could have an impact on systemic cytokine profile, as at T1, after 8-weeks of probiotic supplementation, the serum levels of IL-12RA, IL-6, TNF-α were significantly reduced.
However, this result could also reflect the natural history of COVID-19, as at the T1 COVID-19 acute form is more remote compared to baseline, thus we should take in account also the hypothesis of a natural cytokine decrease due to the overcome of the acute disease, more than an effect related to the probiotic supplementation. Clearly, the absence of a placebo group in our study represents a major limitation, as it does not allow us to definitely interpret this data as natural history of disease or a real immunological impact of the probiotic supplementation.
Some studies about SARS-CoV-2 inflammation have already shown how, during infection, serum levels of IL-1b, TNF-α and other cytokines were higher in infected patients than in healthy adults [29] and the highest IL-6 and TNF-α levels correlated with disease severity [30,31], suggesting cytokine levels as good indicator of therapeutic goal [32]. This evidence may support the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation could have a positive impact on cytokine profile reduction.
Before and after probiotic supplementation, ecology of the microbial ecosystems appeared characterized by an increase in richness, though this was not of statistical significance, but were represented by an increased quantity of Streptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae at T1, the latter being statistically significant and corroborated at L6 by the increase of the Bifidobacterium spp. Remarkably, the LEfSe algorithm, exploited for searching of potential microbial biomarkers, identified six top-ranking ASVs overall characterizing the GM at the T1 time-point. Amongst the others, Actinobacteria (L2, phylum), Bifidobacteriales (L4, Order), Bifidobacteriaceae (L5, family); Bifidobacterium were consistent with the probiotic composition. Additionally, based on the ML model classification analysis, the two ecological microbial ecosystems at T0 and T1 were correctly classified at L2 level by 87.50% score and the microbial ecosystem at T1 was predicted with a 100.00% score, based on the feature Actinobacteria, phylum of the Bifidobacterium spp. At level L5 and L6, behind specific Bifidobacterium family- and genera-related, the most important features resulted overall SCFAs producers, well characterizing the GM of the patients at T1, compared to T0, regardless a lower performance score (i.e., 58.33) compared to the values based on L2 feature. Based on these results, Bifidobacterium spp. seem to be the most functionally active component of the multi-strain probiotic product as it strongly characterized the GM ecology after supplementation. Indeed, further metabolomics-based investigations could unveil biochemical pathways of probiotic metabolite-derived, as already performed for functional assessment of probiotic supplementations in other diseases [33].
Amongst the 97 GM functional KOs signatures, up or down represented for the T0- and T1-related ASV datasets, 12 were unique Kos associated to the only pre-treatment time point T0, but completely absent at T1. Particularly, the K18216 and the K18217, both defined as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, tetracycline resistant protein, were associated to the metabolic pathways TetAB(46), a predicted heterodimeric ABC transporter conferring tetracycline resistance and to steB/tetB46, respectively, apparently conferring ABC transporter tetracycline resistance in a member of the oral microbiota in the first case [34] and acting as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, tetracycline resistant protein in the other [24]. This data could suggest a possible role of probiotic supplementation in enhancing the clearance of antibiotic-resistant genes in GM of patients that received antibiotic therapy during COVID-19. In fact, 10/19 patients had been treated with single or combined (subsequent or concomitant) antibiotics -including amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, clarithromycin or azithromycin- for prophylaxis or treatment of bacterial complication of COVID-19 during the hospitalization.
Interestingly, Spearman’s correlation highlighted significant negative correlation between citrulline and ASV at L2 (Actinobacteria), L5 (Bifidobacteriaceae) and L6 (Bifidobacterium) (FDR adjusted p values < 0.05). Also, significant negative correlation between IL-6 and ASV was observed but only at L2 (Bacteroidetes) and L5 (Methanobacteriaceae) (p values < 0.05).
In this context, we better understand the apparently surprisingly reduction of serum citrulline after supplementation. In fact, in the literature, citrulline has been used as a quantitative enterocyte mass marker [27] and it generally decreased during an acute mucosal damage and subsequently increased because of epithelial healing. However, the decrease of citrulline in our cohort after supplementation was not probably related to gut barrier damage, as it was not related to significant changes in tight junctions’ function as demonstrated by no change in serum zonulin. Furthermore, notwithstanding a significant reduction compared to baseline, both baseline and T1 values remained in physiological range. This apparently unexpected curve of serum citrulline did not seem to be related to variation on enterocyte mass, but in this functional context, its modification could be related to a shift in GM ecology and bacterial metabolism. In fact, we showed an inverse correlation between serum citrulline and Bifidobacterium spp. probably due to specific amino acids-linked metabolic pathways, as already reported for GM Akkermansia [25] and not to physiological effects.

"Predicting the Classification of Home Oxygen Therapy for Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation Patients Using a Neural Network
","Objective: We evaluated the accuracy of a neural network to classify and predict the possibility of home oxygen therapy at the time of discharge from hospital based on patient information post-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at admission. Methods: Patients who survived acute treatment with COVID-19 and were admitted to the Amagasaki Medical Co-operative Hospital during August 2020–December 2021 were included. However, only rehabilitation patients (n = 88) who were discharged after a rehabilitation period of at least 2 weeks and not via home or institution were included. The neural network model implemented in R for Windows (4.1.2) was trained using data on patient age, gender, and number of days between a positive polymerase chain reaction test and hospitalization, length of hospital stay, oxygen flow rate required at hospitalization, and ability to perform activities of daily living. The number of training trials was 100. We used the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as evaluation indicators for the classification model. Results: The model of states at rest had as AUC of 0.82, sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 88.9%, and model accuracy of 86.4%. The model of states on exertion had an ACU of 0.82, sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 81.3%, and model accuracy of 81.8%. Conclusion: The accuracy of this study’s neural network model is comparable to that of previous studies recommended by Japanese Guidelines for the Physical Therapy and is expected to be used in clinical practice. In future, it could be used as a more accurate clinical support tool by increasing the sample size and applying cross-validation.","Demeco et al. stated that COVID-19 survivors might suffer from severe sequelae and be bedridden in the intensive care unit for long periods20). We have seen in practice that the longer the patients stay in the hospital, the more difficult it is for the rehabilitation staff to predict the patient’s condition at discharge. In this study, we investigated whether neural networks could be used to help predict the state of patients at discharge in post-COVID-19 patients.
The ESO2 model selected in this study had a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 88.9%, while the EWO2 model had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 83.3%, respectively. The first edition of the guidelines for physical therapy practice developed by the Japanese Physical Therapy Association21) recommended the “geriatric depression scale” as a Grade A assessment tool with high reliability and validity; the sensitivity of this assessment tool was 0.78 and specificity was 0.85 when used in Parkinson’s patients22). In addition, the “timed up and go test” was recommended as a Grade A assessment tool by the Japanese Guidelines for the Physical Therapy to classify elderly patients at a high risk of falling21), and the cut-off value for this assessment tool was reported to be 87% for both sensitivity and specificity23). The sensitivity and specificity of the model selected in this study were comparable to those of the recommended Grade A assessment tool of the Japanese Guidelines for the Physical Therapy, and its classification performance was not necessarily poor. However, we don’t claim the same reliability for these models as for the recommended Grade A of the guidelines. When referring to the model’s accuracy, it is necessary to discuss the sample size.
The sample size that we were able to collect was small because the participants in this study were patients who had survived COVID-19 and were hospitalized at a single institution for rehabilitation. Previous studies reported that it was difficult to collect a sufficient sample size in studies where data were collected on human subjects24). It is known that there is a risk of overfitting to noise in the training data when small sample sizes are used in machine learning25). However, it cannot be said that the small sample size in this study reduced the model’s prediction accuracy of new data. In a literature review of the prediction of brain injury diagnoses using machine learning, Arbabshirani et al. reported that many studies that reported high accuracy had sample sizes of less than 100 (median 88)26). In a previous study that surveyed several review articles, Varoquaux reported that the typical sample size was 100 when large datasets were inherently difficult to obtain and that the prediction accuracy of machine learning was higher with smaller sample sizes than with larger ones27). However, small sample sizes tended to increase the confidence intervals for prediction accuracy27), so increasing the sample size was an ongoing issue in our model. The survey items (a)–(f) used as input variables for the model in this study were not research-specific items but instead common data that have been routinely measured in clinical practice. Therefore, the data set could be further expanded in the future. In addition, if we applied cross-validation to the predictive model, we could bring the model closer to the best accuracy from the same data and reduce the risk of deriving an inappropriate model28). However, since cross-validation was not applied in this study, it should be noted that there was a risk of overfitting due to biased data.
In a previous study, Lin et al.29) predicted the ability to perform ADL in post-stroke patients using a machine learning- based method and stated that it was a practical tool in clinical practice based on the predictive accuracy of the results with AUC = 0.79. Makino et al. used logistic regression to predict the degree of progression of diabetic kidney disease30). They reported the mean AUC of 0.743 and the mean accuracy of 71%, which could support clinical decisions. Based on these previous studies, we believe that the accuracy of the model in this study has the potential to support predictions made by rehabilitation staff in clinical practice regarding home oxygen therapy in post-COVID-19 patients.
One of the limitations of this study was that comorbidities could not be included in the features. Although comorbidities are known as predictors of the prognosis of COVID-19, the date and classification of comorbidities could not be defined in this study due to the limited amount of information in the electronic medical records. This model was limited to patient information from a single facility. It was also necessary to collect patient information from multiple institutions to make the model more general.

"Evolving phenotypes of non-hospitalized patients that indicate long COVID
","Background
For some SARS-CoV-2 survivors, recovery from the acute phase of the infection has been grueling with lingering effects. Many of the symptoms characterized as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of PASC phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection.
Methods
In this retrospective electronic health record (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3–6 and 6–9 months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston Metropolitan Area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized.
Results
We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients’ medical records 2 months or longer after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.94–3.46]), alopecia (OR 3.09, 95% CI [2.53–3.76]), chest pain (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.09–1.48]), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22–2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22–1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28–2.16]), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22–1.64]) is one of the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection. Additionally, more new phenotypes were found with increased confidence among the cohorts who were younger than 65.
Conclusions
The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID-19 symptoms and suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of COVID-19 than those without the infection. Additionally, more than 63% of PASC phenotypes were observed in patients under 65 years of age, pointing out the importance of vaccination to minimize the risk of debilitating post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 among younger adults.
","We identified 33 phenotypes that were indicative of long COVID among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Phenotypes such as alopecia, anosmia, fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain have been well documented as common signs and symptoms of PASC [7, 35, 36]. This study shows that these phenotypes are some of the earliest associations with the syndrome seen in the 3–6-month window after the initial infection and some of the most important features for indicating previous COVID-19 infection. All five of these phenotypes (alopecia, anosmia and dysgeusia, shortness of breath, chronic fatigue syndrome, and non-specific chest pain) were documented with high confidence in the 3–6-month window. And while alopecia and non-specific chest pain were not found with high confidence in the 6–9-month window, anosmia and chronic fatigue syndrome continued to be important phenotypes seen in both time periods. Additionally, several phenotypes were identified with similarly high confidence including type II diabetes, pneumonia, proteinuria, and syncope and collapse.
Interestingly, those aged less than 65 had more new phenotypes identified with greater confidence than the cohorts who were older than 65. Over 63% of the identified long COVID phenotypes were observed in past COVID-19 patients who were under 65 years old. These findings have important implications for younger patients. Despite having not been hospitalized during the acute phase, the symptoms of long COVID are found with high confidence in this younger cohort population. This gives another reason for young patients to opt for having the vaccination since the long-term effects of the disease are clearly not limited to older patients. While the precise biological causes of the sequelae are still unknown and under investigation, the enrichment of these diagnoses among younger cohorts may indicate that the robustness of the immune response in these patients is driving some of the post-COVID sequelae. However, these results should be understood and qualified in the context that, on average, younger patients who are often healthier than 65 and older have fewer interactions with healthcare systems (and thus fewer diagnosis records), which may lead to greater ease in detecting a signal in this younger cohort compared to an older cohort.
While the chart review’s primary purpose was to determine if the clinical notes were in agreement with the ICD-9/10 labels, the reviewer also noted that physicians consistently attributed two of the phenotypes (alopecia, and anosmia and dysgeusia) to a previous history of COVID-19, whereas the physicians’ notes did not specifically identify a connection between the phenotype and the previous infection for most of the other phenotypes, even those with high confidence like type 2 diabetes or non-specific chest pain. Our model indicates that even if these phenotypes are not explicitly identified or recognized by the clinician and patient at the individual level, many of these unrecognized phenotypes still have a high confidence score. While an ICD code on its own does not specify the time of onset, the chart review helped to confirm that the presented phenotypes were likely new since COVID-19. The majority of charts reviewed for each phenotype suggest that the symptoms or the diagnosis occurred after COVID-19. Our model identifies the relationships between COVID and a phenotype, where a healthcare provider and patient may otherwise miss that relationship.
Several neurological phenotypes (vascular dementia, dementia, and neurological disorders) were frequently diagnosed after COVID and appear to have an increased association with the infection. The neurological disorder phenotype includes several ICD codes, and in a random sampling of patients with this phenotype, the majority had the ICD code “R41.89—other symptoms and signs involving cognitive function and awareness.” Collectively, these phenotypes suggest ongoing cognitive dysfunction. The earliest reports of acute COVID, such as Mao’s retrospective analysis of 214 hospitalized patients in China, described neurological manifestations, including cerebrovascular complications, in nearly half of those with severe disease [37]. Since the acute phase, the sequelae for the description of “brain fog” after the diagnosis of COVID have been repeatedly described [38, 39]. Al-Aly specifically documents increased memory problems and strokes [40]. Our model suggests that these cognitive deficits are ongoing and in some cases may be so severe they are even lead to an initial formal diagnosis of dementia at higher rates among those with a history of COVID. While many of these patients may have already shown some signs of memory loss, the formal diagnosis of dementia did not come until after COVID-19 suggesting that the viral illness may have contributed to a worsening of their condition and the formal declaration of this diagnosis.
Another important phenotype identified was type 2 diabetes. Several studies have pointed out possible pathophysiological relationships between COVID-19 and diabetes [41, 42]. And the increased incidence of a number of metabolic diseases has been found with those after a COVID-19 diagnosis [40]. Our study indicates that the metabolic disorder may be so significant as to lead to a formal diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
The disease of the nail phenotype includes a variety of diagnoses including leukonychia, onycholysis, onychomadesis, Mees’ lines, Muehrcke’s lines, and Beau’s lines all of which are markers of overall well-being and have been associated with infections and renal or hepatic dysfunction previously. Beau’s lines have specifically been associated with COVID-19 infections [43, 44]. Our results suggest this association is widespread and likely a result of systemic infection including renal injury.
Proteinuria was also identified as having an association with COVID-19 among male patients less than 65. COVID-19 has previously been associated with acute kidney injury [45], and proteinuria is a known surrogate for kidney disease [46]. The identification of proteinuria as an association with COVID-19 in the young patient cohort suggests the insult of COVID-19 to the kidneys persists months after the infection has resolved.
The MLHO framework appears to be more powerful than univariate PheWAS. A small number of phenotypes that had a relatively high unadjusted statistical significance (a p-value between 0.01 and 0.001) would have been dropped in a linear univariate PheWAS after p-value correction for multiple hypotheses. Two examples of such phenotypes are palpitations and non-specific chest pain, both of which have previously been described as common symptoms of PASC [7, 35, 36].
MLHO’s implementation in this study is similar to the standard univariate PheWAS [28, 29] as both offer computational solutions for high-throughput association mining from clinical data. However, a challenge in standard PheWAS is to find a sensible balance between adequately applying a correction to p-values in order to reduce false discovery due to multiple testing and minimizing false negatives [47]. Our approach expands the univariate p-value dependent criteria for identifying phenome-wide associations to a more comprehensive and multivariate entropy-based process. MLHO iteratively applies joint mutual information, performs sparsity screening, and uses gradient boosting to characterize the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. The iterative process in MLHO provides means to an interpretable probabilistic confidence score for each phenotype associated with a past positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test.
Augmented with clinical expertise (i.e., chart reviews), MLHO’s computational algorithms avoid a flood of false-positive discoveries while offering a more robust probabilistic approach than the standard PheWAS. We were able to evaluate over 1600 phenotypes and identify a small number of phenotypes (with confidence scores) that associate with a past COVID-19 infection. As a result, and along with the inclusion of COVID-negative patients, this study rules out some of the phenotype associations, which were previously identified through poorly controlled observational data, such as cutaneous eruptions outside of nail changes and alopecia.
We acknowledge that this study’s findings may present limitations due to the use of only diagnosis codes, which can result in missing signs and symptoms that are in clinical notes and laboratory results. In addition, given the intensity of the pandemic and spread of misinformation, EHR data may represent confirmatory bias between providers and patients. Replicating this study in other institutions would help elucidate if the clinical phenotypes seen at MGB reflect true characteristics of PASC or local healthcare utilization patterns. Additionally, we only included diagnoses that were used for the first time at least 2 months after the COVID-positive PCR date. This may have led to some missed diagnoses that began within 2 months of the start of the acute phase; however, it helps ensure that the new diagnoses detected were not related to the acute phase. Future studies can consider modifying this time buffer; however, there will remain a trade-off between capturing all subsequent diagnoses and increasing the confidence that the diagnoses are not part of the acute phase of the illness. Finally, we have excluded hospitalized COVID-19 patients. On the one hand, it would be difficult to match hospitalized coronavirus patients during the COVID era with non-COVID hospitalized patients. On the other hand, the post-COVID syndrome can still be observed in patients who were never hospitalized [12, 48–52]. Regardless, future PASC studies should include hospitalized patients.

"Investigation of liquid biopsy analytes in peripheral blood of individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection
","Background
Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is linked to severe organ damage. The identification and stratification of at-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is vital to providing appropriate care. This exploratory study looks for a potential liquid biopsy signal for PACS using both manual and machine learning approaches.
Methods
Using a high definition single cell assay (HDSCA) workflow for liquid biopsy, we analysed 100 Post-COVID patients and 19 pre-pandemic normal donor (ND) controls. Within our patient cohort, 73 had received at least 1 dose of vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We stratified the COVID patients into 25 asymptomatic, 22 symptomatic COVID-19 but not suspected for PACS and 53 PACS suspected. All COVID-19 patients investigated in this study were diagnosed between April 2020 and January 2022 with a median 243 days (range 16–669) from diagnosis to their blood draw. We did a histopathological examination of rare events in the peripheral blood and used a machine learning model to evaluate predictors of PACS.
Findings
The manual classification found rare cellular and acellular events consistent with features of endothelial cells and platelet structures in the PACS-suspected cohort. The three categories encompassing the hypothesised events were observed at a significantly higher incidence in the PACS-suspected cohort compared to the ND (p-value < 0.05). The machine learning classifier performed well when separating the NDs from Post-COVID with an accuracy of 90.1%, but poorly when separating the patients suspected and not suspected of PACS with an accuracy of 58.7%.
Interpretation
Both the manual and the machine learning model found differences in the Post-COVID cohort and the NDs, suggesting the existence of a liquid biopsy signal after active SARS-CoV-2 infection. More research is needed to stratify PACS and its subsyndromes.
","Herein, we investigate whether individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection carry a liquid biopsy signature in their PB using an assay configuration that was previously validated in carcinoma and myocardial infarction patients. To this end, we utilise the liquid biopsy assay on PB samples drawn from individuals with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and ND PB samples collected pre-pandemic. In PACS Suspected samples, via manual data reduction of rare events, we detected an increased count of hypothesised endothelial cells and platelet structures. Using a machine learning classifier approach, based on the rare event profile, we were able to separate controls from COVID-19 recovered individuals and sub cohorts thereof. Furthermore, the classifier exhibited a fair performance when separating Post-SYMP COVID and Post-ASYMP COVID cohorts. Our findings suggest that rare event analysis from the liquid biopsy should be further investigated as an inclusion in Post-COVID patient management.
Circulating endothelial cells have been used to identify cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 related cardiovascular damage.26, 27, 28 In a previous study, we determined that our liquid biopsy pipeline was able to identify circulating endothelial cells in myocardial infarction patients.18 Many studies have described the vascular dysfunction during active SARS-CoV-2 infection,29 and some suggest that COVID-19 related capillary damage may contribute to long term symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia.30 Consistent with previous findings, we were able to detect endothelial-like events in the Post-COVID cohort. The channel-type classification of rare cells associated with endothelial-like cells was identified at a statistically higher incidence in the PACS Suspected compared to ND. Direct evidence of cardiovascular damage through a liquid biopsy analysis may allow for healthcare providers to focus treatment and target resources appropriately. Further molecular characterisation of the hypothesised endothelial cells is needed to confirm their origin.
Another well documented event in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the presence of microclots or platelet aggregates.31,32 One autopsy study found microclots to be 9 times more prevalent in the pulmonary capillaries of deceased COVID-19 patients than those who died of influenzae.33 Preliminary studies have also suggested the presence of persistent microclots in the PB of PACS patients.34 In our patient samples, through manual data reduction, we detected a statistically significant increase of acellular events compared to that of the NDs. These acellular events match the morphology and biomarker expression profile of platelet structures. We hypothesise that these events are associated with the formation of microclots in the capillaries due to vascular damage. Microclots may be the cause of capillary blockage and reduced oxygen exchange in tissues, leading to fatigue and muscle weakness which are common symptoms of PACS.35 While molecular characterisation and clinical correlation analysis is still needed, platelet aggregates or microclots may be a therapeutic target for PACS treatments.
The cohort level classifier was successful in separating ND samples from the Post-COVID cohort and its clinical subdivisions. This result indicates differences in the frequency of liquid biopsy analytes within the PB of Post-COVID cohort and NDs. When separating Post-COVID sub cohorts with NDs, the classifier sensitivity was above or equal to 90% for all COVID-19 sub cohorts except PACS Suspected, with a value of 87.1%. Furthermore, the specificity was greater than or equal to 80% for all cases, except ND vs Post-ASYMP COVID, with a specificity of 75%. The lower performance on separating Post-ASYMP COVID from ND is anticipated as asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are expected to have less physiological damage. The separation suggests post-infection changes in the circulatory system, and, with a median time between COVID-19 diagnosis and blood draw of over 200 days for the Post-COVID cohort, these changes seem to be long lasting.
When separating major clinical subdivisions of the Post-COVID cohort, the classifier demonstrated a mixed performance. In the case of Post-SYMP COVID vs Post-ASYMP COVID, the model exhibited fair performance with sensitivity of 69.6%, and specificity of 78.0%, suggesting that liquid biopsy analytes can reflect on the severity of symptoms during infection. In the case of PACS Suspected vs PACS Not Suspected the model demonstrated poor performance, with sensitivity of 59.4% and specificity of 52.5%. In contrast to the symptomatic identifier, which has a clear clinical definition, PACS remains ill defined. Furthermore, PACS can be diagnosed due to symptoms in a variety of organ systems and combinations thereof, explaining poor model performance. Taken together, these attributes may explain the poor performance of the classifier in this setting.
There were several limitations to our study. First, we primarily relied on patient self-reported symptoms during recruitment and only collected a single blood draw from each patient. Future trial designs will use a stricter inclusion criteria with physician evaluated PACS and a narrower range of symptoms as well as incorporate multiple blood draws for longitudinal observation. Furthermore, the current study has a limited sample size and the generalisability of the results can be tested in a larger cohort. Another limitation is the use of only five biomarkers in the current four channel immunofluorescence analysis. However, using the HDSCA3.0 workflow, we can conduct downstream molecular characterisation of single events, using single cell genomics and targeted multiplexed proteomics.17,36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Proteomic analysis may confirm our hypotheses on CECs and platelet structures presented here, while also describing the immune cell profile of Post-COVID patients. Since the Post-COVID cohort did include cancer patients, genomic analysis will be important to differentiate the liquid biopsy signal for cancer vs Post-COVID or PACS. We also recognise that additional comorbidities may also affect the outcome of this study and will be further investigated in larger cohorts. A final limitation was the number of ND samples analysed as controls were limited due to the difficulty in acquiring PB draws collected prior to the beginning of the pandemic.

"Chronic inflammation, neutrophil activity, and autoreactivity splits long COVID
","While immunologic correlates of COVID-19 have been widely reported, their associations with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remain less clear. Due to the wide array of PASC presentations, understanding if specific disease features associate with discrete immune processes and therapeutic opportunities is important. Here we profile patients in the recovery phase of COVID-19 via proteomics screening and machine learning to find signatures of ongoing antiviral B cell development, immune-mediated fibrosis, and markers of cell death in PASC patients but not in controls with uncomplicated recovery. Plasma and immune cell profiling further allow the stratification of PASC into inflammatory and non-inflammatory types. Inflammatory PASC, identifiable through a refined set of 12 blood markers, displays evidence of ongoing neutrophil activity, B cell memory alterations, and building autoreactivity more than a year post COVID-19. Our work thus helps refine PASC categorization to aid in both therapeutic targeting and epidemiological investigation of PASC.
","Clinical heterogeneity in patients with PASC has made it challenging to identify clear biological associations with the disease25. Here, we suggest that PASC should be subclassified into (at least) two distinct conditions, characterized by the presence (inflPASC) or absence (niPASC) of broad inflammatory signatures consistent with high neutrophil activity and qualitative changes in B-cell memory and response. Using high-dimensional proteomics in combination with machine-learning-based modeling, we characterize clear signatures of generalized PASC strongly suggestive of dysregulation of discrete biologic processes underlying disease that may be tractable for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Although traditional feature-wise testing showed an inflammatory component to PASC as a whole, a finding largely in agreement with emerging literature, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1B were not identified as strong candidates for the discrimination of PASC when modeling the totality of blood protein content. Instead, signatures of complement and clotting cascades, active antigen processing, and EGFR signaling were more consistently associated across the group, with the identification of unanticipated targets, such as EREG, that may hold important diagnostic and therapeutic value. These findings are particularly interesting in light of recent work suggesting EREGs role, among other things, in pain sensation29, inflammatory dysregulation and autoimmunity33, and maintenance of pulmonary fibrosis30.
Likewise, proteomics-based clustering of PASC patients revealed a clear subset of patients closely associated with inflammatory immune signatures strongly suggestive of neutrophilic activity. Through readily available clinical testing, these inflPASC patients displayed neutrophil expansion correlating with both fibrinogen levels and biomarkers of degranulation and NET formation. Strikingly, many of the proteomics signatures associated with these patients, including IL-8, IL-1B, and IFI30, were highly reminiscent of recent work identifying transcriptional reprogramming of lung-infiltrating neutrophils that contributes to self-sustaining pathogenic neutrophilia in severe COVID-1913. This, alongside the known pathology associated with aberrantly regulated NET formation34 and the recent success of the neutrophil-modulator metformin in reducing PASC emergence by more than 40% in clinical trial cohorts35. It will be important to understand the significance of the correlation of these neutrophil signatures in these patients with clotting cascade members (Fig. 3i), their combined contribution to the clotting abnormalities identified in COVID-19 recovery and PASC36, and their detailed associations with clinical manifestations of PASC in larger longitudinal cohort studies. The streamlined approach to identifying these patients outlined here will greatly aid in those efforts.
It is important to note that while these clinical markers such as neutrophil counts and fibrinogen are elevated within the inflPASC group, they do not necessarily reflect ‘abnormal’ test results in all cases. That is, the testing of any marker independently may not, by itself, indicate clear disorder. Instead, the elevation of multiple markers, even when within “normal” ranges, seem to best reflect the broad inflammatory signals identified in the proteomics screen. This finding only emphasizes the need to develop tools capable of providing nuanced assessment across a variety of clinical parameters in patient classification. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that niPASC is defined only as the absence of the robust inflammatory signature identified in inflPASC by comparison, and not as the absence of disease. As others have now shown20, and we show here (Fig. 2b, h), biological associations such as EREG upregulation and cortisol levels8,20 can be readily identified across a wide spectrum of PASC even independent of clear inflammatory signaling. It will be critical to understand how all of these signatures predict, and potentially contribute to, long-term patient morbidity.
A surprising finding from these data, in combination with the published literature25, is the difficulty in discriminating disease subtype through symptom presentation alone. While clear trends do emerge based on subclassification, symptom presentation alone is a poor discriminator of the inflPASC and niPASC groups despite their discordant underlying biology. It is notable, however, that in chronic autoimmune disorders, differences in underlying biology can heavily impact treatment success independently of overall disease presentation37. In the case of PASC, and based on the data presented here, two patients with highly similar symptomatic presentations might respond differently to immunomodulatory therapy. As a result, it is important to move beyond symptomatic presentation as a primary method for the classification of patients in therapeutic trial designs.
It is also important to understand how the signatures reported here might evolve over the course of the disease. While our cross-sectional approach defines clear lines between inflPASC and niPASC, and it is clear that inflPASC can present well beyond the expected phase of COVID-19 recovery, it is not yet clear if these presentations are mutually exclusive. In the case of reservoir-based viral reactivation as a main driver of PASC, as several have argued38, it could be that inflPASC manifestations are an observation of an inflammatory phase of cyclic reactivation rather than a discrete patient subtype. However, it is worth considering that the trending differences in symptomatology between the groups and differential persistence of autoantibodies argue against this interpretation. Alternatively, the distinction between inflPASC and niPASC could reflect a difference in the physiologic location of a viral repository. This would be consistent with the variability in memory isotype selection differences between the niPASC and inflPASC group despite the identification of antigen-specific aN B cells in both PASC subtypes strongly suggesting ongoing EF B-cell activation, presumably due to persistence viral antigens. If confirmed, the continued reliance on these EF-derived clonotypes for memory retention could have long-term implications in both ongoing cross-reactivity and self-targeting as well as the potential for self-sustaining autoimmune development in a subset of patients.
The overwhelming disease burden attributable to PASC worldwide6 demands that serious attention must be paid both to its accurate diagnosis as well as potential therapeutic avenues. The identification of a clear subclassification of PASC with a highly inflammatory presentation is an important first step. Based on these data, it is likely that these two PASC subclassifications may respond differently to the immunomodulatory therapies, particularly those targeted at neutrophil activity and autoimmune B-cell development, currently being investigated in large-scale clinical trials. Using machine-learning approaches, we have identified critical factors that can be used as positive classifiers of inlfPASC with a high degree of sensitivity and precision. While initial characterization of this heterogeneity required high-dimensional and unbiased screening, we found that a small subset of features that could be tested at scale, selected through novel assessments of feature potency, was nearly as performant when considered alone. Further, our integration of these data with classical in-clinic blood counts, clotting tests, autoreactive screening, and inflammatory marker assessment suggests that there may be several viable avenues to the positive identification of inflPASC patients without the need for highly specialized technology. These assessments could be easily integrated into ongoing clinical trials to understand if therapeutics exert discordant effects on specific patient groups and reduce the potential for false-negative outcomes due to patient heterogeneity.

"Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms
","Background and purpose: ""Brain fog"" is a frequent and disabling symptom that can occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, its clinical characteristics and the relationships among brain fog and objective cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety) are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to examine the characteristics of brain fog and to understand how fatigue, cognitive performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and the mutual relationships among these variables influence subjective cognitive complaints.
Methods: A total of 170 patients with cognitive complaints in the context of post-COVID syndrome were evaluated using a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. The FLEI scale was used to characterize subjective cognitive complaints. Correlation analysis, regression machine-learning algorithms, and mediation analysis were calculated.
Results: Cognitive complaints were mainly attention and episodic memory symptoms, while executive functions (planning) issues were less often reported. The FLEI scale, a mental ability questionnaire, showed high correlations with a fatigue scale and moderate correlations with the Stroop test, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Random forest algorithms showed an R2 value of 0.409 for the prediction of FLEI score, with several cognitive tests, fatigue and depression being the best variables used in the prediction. Mediation analysis showed that fatigue was the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition, while the effect of depression was indirect and mediated through fatigue.
Conclusions: Brain fog associated with COVID-19 is mainly characterized by attention and episodic memory, and fatigue, which is the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition. Our findings contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of brain fog and emphasize the need to unravel the main mechanisms underlying brain fog, considering several aspects.
","This study evaluated a large cohort of patients with PCS. They were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including a questionnaire on subjective perception and objective cognitive testing for the main cognitive domains. Our findings revealed that cognitive complaints were mainly focused on attention and episodic memory, while executive functions (planning) issues were less reported. It is well known that there may be significant discrepancies between subjective cognitive experiences and objective neuropsychological performance, as shown in other disorders [26, 27]. On the one hand, daily-life situations may be more complex and more demanding (and more likely to be influenced by external factors such as distractions or emotional factors) than neuropsychological examinations. On the other hand, cognitive complaints may be the final outcome of several processes, including cognitive functioning but also fatigue or neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, mood disorders could also distort subjective cognitive perception. For this reason, in our study, patients were also assessed for fatigue, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep quality [28]. Interestingly, subjective cognition showed statistically significant correlations with several of these factors, especially with fatigue followed by depression and anxiety. Higher levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were associated with poorer subjective cognitive perception. Regarding cognitive testing, cognitive complaints were mainly correlated with the Stroop test, followed by SDMT, Digit Span Forward and semantic fluency. In this case, higher levels of cognitive complaints were correlated with lower cognitive performance. These results confirm that cognitive complaints were especially correlated with attention/processing speed, the most impaired cognitive domain in PCS [29].
Analysis of cognitive complaints according to the domains measured in the questionnaire led to interesting findings. Patients with more severe acute disease that required intensive care unit admission reported higher levels of cognitive dysfunction. This is consistent with more severe cognitive deficits in these patients and more severe neuroimaging changes [12].
We implemented several regression machine-learning algorithms to predict the severity of cognitive complaints using neuropsychological tests and other scales. Random forest, one of the most popular algorithms, obtained the best results, confirming that these variables (objective cognition, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric scales) are able to predict the presence of cognitive complaints with moderate accuracy. Furthermore, we complemented the analysis using mediation models. These models try to identify, explain, and quantify the underlying processes between an independent and dependent variable through one or more mediators. In this case, we examined the influence of several mediators (fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep quality) in the relationship between the cause (cognitive dysfunction) and the effect (cognitive complaints). We observed that fatigue mediated the effect between cognitive function and cognitive complaints. Conversely, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality did not have a statistically significant effect. However, when all the variables were included in the same model, the indirect effect was mainly explained by fatigue, while anxiety did not have a statistically significant effect, and the importance of depression was lower than fatigue. Intriguingly, in a more complex model, fatigue remained the main variable mediating the effect between objective and subjective cognition directly and throughout depression, which also had a role in mediating the effect. The magnitude of the effect was greater in the route cognition–depression–fatigue–FLEI than in cognition–fatigue–FLEI. This confirms that depression also plays a prominent role, especially due to the relationship with fatigue, but not an isolated role. This is consistent with previous reports in other disorders, in which fatigue and depression are interconnected and might share some pathophysiological mechanisms [30, 31]. In this study, we focused on central fatigue, a multidimensional concept that arises from the dissociation of inputs (e.g., motivation) and the perception of effort. Depression, which is associated with a loss of motivation, may also cause a subjective sense of fatigue [32, 33].
These findings have important practical implications. According to our findings, “brain fog” may be interpreted as the result of two main processes: objective cognitive impairment and fatigue. Regarding the other factors, only depression showed an influence mediated by fatigue. This underscores the importance of comprehensive cognitive (especially attention and processing speed and episodic memory) and fatigue assessments in patients reporting subjective cognitive complaints. Thus, a report of brain fog in the context of a neuropsychological assessment within normal limits should suggest a greater role of cognitive fatigue and vice versa. In this regard, the combination of cognitive testing, fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms is necessary when evaluating patients reporting cognitive complaints. Cognitive testing should be focused on attention and processing speed tests (e.g., Stroop, SDMT), but other tests should also be necessary to evaluate the state of the other cognitive domains and for differential diagnosis [34]. Furthermore, mediation analysis suggests that future studies to alleviate brain fog in these patients should focus on the improvement of cognitive functioning and fatigue. In this regard, some clinical trials on cognitive training and/or non-invasive brain stimulation have shown positive results [35, 36]. Further studies examining the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms in PCS patients and the relationship between fatigue and depression are also necessary. Due to the weak effect of depressive symptoms, antidepressant therapies could not have a direct role in brain fog but might have an indirect role by modulating fatigue. Overall, the interplay among cognitive deficits, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms should be considered in the design of future clinical trials addressing brain fog and PCS. In addition, quantitative assessment of peripheral fatigue, the consideration of previous therapies during the acute and post-acute phase (e.g., corticosteroids), and immune dysregulation and endocrine system status (e.g., the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis) may be of interest in future studies to further understand the complexities of fatigue and cognitive function.
Our study has some limitations. First, fatigue was assessed using the MFIS. Although this scale is one of the most validated and comprehensive scales for fatigue rating across different disorders, some questions may show a certain overlap with the FLEI questionnaire. This could lead us to overestimate the influence of fatigue in brain fog. Similarly, clinical symptoms of fatigue and depression partially overlap, and differential diagnosis may be challenging. Second, we used the FLEI scale as a proxy for brain fog. We preferred this scale over others because it covers the main symptoms present in PCS. However, further studies using other scales would be necessary to confirm our findings. Third, we did not measure emotional distress, another psychological dimension relevant in patients with PCS [37]. Fourth, although our neuropsychological protocol was comprehensive and covered the main cognitive domains, a more complete examination of executive functions would be of interest. In this regard, the FLEI scale examines executive function issues in daily living, focusing on planning, but a specific test of planning abilities (e.g., tower tests) was not included in the protocol.
In conclusion, brain fog is mainly characterized by attention and episodic memory complaints. Cognitive tests associated with attention/processing speed and fatigue were the most important factors underlying brain fog. Fatigue was the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition. The effect of depression in brain fog was indirect and mediated through fatigue. Our findings emphasize the role of fatigue and cognitive functioning in the pathophysiology of brain fog and support the need to consider several factors in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with PCS reporting brain fog.

"Using Social Media to Help Understand Patient-Reported Health Outcomes of Post-COVID-19 Condition: Natural Language Processing Approach
","Background
While scientific knowledge of post–COVID-19 condition (PCC) is growing, there remains significant uncertainty in the definition of the disease, its expected clinical course, and its impact on daily functioning. Social media platforms can generate valuable insights into patient-reported health outcomes as the content is produced at high resolution by patients and caregivers, representing experiences that may be unavailable to most clinicians.
Objective
In this study, we aimed to determine the validity and effectiveness of advanced natural language processing approaches built to derive insight into PCC-related patient-reported health outcomes from social media platforms Twitter and Reddit. We extracted PCC-related terms, including symptoms and conditions, and measured their occurrence frequency. We compared the outputs with human annotations and clinical outcomes and tracked symptom and condition term occurrences over time and locations to explore the pipeline’s potential as a surveillance tool.
Methods
We used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models to extract and normalize PCC symptom and condition terms from English posts on Twitter and Reddit. We compared 2 named entity recognition models and implemented a 2-step normalization task to map extracted terms to unique concepts in standardized terminology. The normalization steps were done using a semantic search approach with BERT biencoders. We evaluated the effectiveness of BERT models in extracting the terms using a human-annotated corpus and a proximity-based score. We also compared the validity and reliability of the extracted and normalized terms to a web-based survey with more than 3000 participants from several countries.
Results
UmlsBERT-Clinical had the highest accuracy in predicting entities closest to those extracted by human annotators. Based on our findings, the top 3 most commonly occurring groups of PCC symptom and condition terms were systemic (such as fatigue), neuropsychiatric (such as anxiety and brain fog), and respiratory (such as shortness of breath). In addition, we also found novel symptom and condition terms that had not been categorized in previous studies, such as infection and pain. Regarding the co-occurring symptoms, the pair of fatigue and headaches was among the most co-occurring term pairs across both platforms. Based on the temporal analysis, the neuropsychiatric terms were the most prevalent, followed by the systemic category, on both social media platforms. Our spatial analysis concluded that 42% (10,938/26,247) of the analyzed terms included location information, with the majority coming from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.
Conclusions
The outcome of our social media–derived pipeline is comparable with the results of peer-reviewed articles relevant to PCC symptoms. Overall, this study provides unique insights into patient-reported health outcomes of PCC and valuable information about the patient’s journey that can help health care providers anticipate future needs.
","Overview
The overarching goal of this study was to highlight the possibility of gaining insight into the patient’s experience of PCC using social media and NLP approaches. User-generated social media data provide a rich yet challenging source of information about the patient's journey outside the health care setting. Significant limitations remain concerning recognizing a patient’s lived experience instead of opinion and aligning common vernacular to recognized medical terminology. However, our study has made progress toward narrowing the data quality gap and evaluating the validity and reliability of social media-driven outcomes regarding PCC using state-of-the-art NLP approaches. Our results suggest that there is value in the learnings and methodologies outlined in this study to gather insights from patient-reported outcomes on social media platforms.
Principal Findings
Our transformer-based entity extraction tool, clinical UmlsBERT, outperformed Stanza and UMLS MetaMap (+AMIA) to extract symptom and condition terms from both Twitter and Reddit. Our results confirm the previous view that augmenting contextual embeddings with expert domains from a knowledge base outperforms domain-specific models on common named-entity recognition inside and outside health care settings [25,38]. The outcome of our NLP pipeline, mapped and normalized symptom and condition terms, was comparable with the outcomes of peer-reviewed papers relevant to PCC symptoms [3,35,36,39]. Our analysis confirms prior findings that PCC is a multisystemic condition affecting multiple organ systems. Our study showed that fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, and shortness of breath are the most commonly occurring groups of terms for PCC symptoms on Twitter and Reddit. This aligns with the primary discoveries of recent studies [3,35,36,39], where the top 3 most debilitating symptoms listed by patients were fatigue, breathing issues, and cognitive impairment.
Our findings support the increasing interest in and confirm the need for supplementing clinical observation with user-generated data [40]. In this study, we reported the frequency of co-occurring symptom and condition terms. Based on our results, the pair of fatigue and headaches was among the most co-occurring terms on both social media platforms; to the best of our knowledge, expressing a combination of symptoms related to PCC has been rarely reported in the literature, certainly not from social media based studies. One instance of clinically derived analysis of symptom co-occurrence comes from a US-based retrospective cohort study [36] evaluating long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors, where they similarly observe that fatigue tends to co-occur frequently with abnormal breathing or shortness of breath in patients with PCC. The potential value of this analysis is in connecting symptom and condition terms early in illness onset with prognostic factors, such as the likelihood of developing PCC, and the severity or duration of the PCC condition.
Our study and the survey study by Davis et al [3] share another point of agreement: uncovering symptoms that are not commonly mentioned in public discussion of PCC, which we call novel symptoms and conditions. Our study revealed that users experienced unique symptoms like infection, hair loss, and weight loss, as well as reported conditions that resembled those of other illnesses such as flu, cancer, or Lyme disease.
One strength of the NLP pipeline developed in this study is its scalability, leading to high-level adaptive capacity for other social media platforms or different medical conditions. Our NLP pipeline is well-poised to scale the information extraction process from user-generated data and connect vernacular to recognized medical ontology. In addition, it enables exploring the longitudinal evolution of symptoms, which may be correlated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants at the time of onset to guide insights into variation in disease course associated with different source viral strains.
Limitations
A common issue with automating entity extraction and normalization is losing the context behind the extracted terms (in the form of independent tokens or words). Without context, it may be difficult to interpret the meaning behind these tokens. For example, the token death could be extracted from a personal opinion, an expression of a feeling, or a factual statement; an example of a personal statement is “I think COVID-19 increases the likelihood of death,” whereas an example of a factual statement is “My cousin died of COVID-19.” In addition, an example of symptom expression tied to the condition is “This long COVID feels like death.” Furthermore, clustering semantically similar extracted symptoms and bringing them closer to predefined standards and common medical terms increases the risk of losing context.
Another limitation of this study relates to our self-report filter. While RegExs are effective in finding posts containing first-person self-reports, they are also prone to false positives—for example, mistakenly keeping a post that voices an opinion or reports symptoms on behalf of someone else—and false negatives—for example, mistakenly discarding a tweet that excludes first-person pronouns but would still qualify as a self-report. We, therefore, considered other context-based approaches, including a fine-tuned BERT classifier. These approaches may reduce false positive and false negative rates; however, further work is needed to annotate sufficient data sets for manually fine-tuning, sweeping, and optimizing hyperparameters.
The nature of social media data and our NLP pipeline introduces bias to our findings, which could impact the reliability of our outcomes. Social media content is unlikely to represent the broader population due to demographic biases in technology uptake, barriers to access, and regional social media platform preferences. Furthermore, only a subset of users are patients who publicly share their experiences with PCC. Users’ self-reports may also be influenced by prominent opinions reinforced on the internet through news media or other social media “influencers,” which adds to sample bias. In addition to inherent bias, our analysis is further biased by including only English-language posts.
In social media, data quality is highly variable due to the use of colloquial language (eg, “I am dying”), brevity or shorthand, and grammatical and spelling errors. Tweets were first collected based on the presence of relevant hashtags and keywords (eg, long COVID). While this approach successfully surfaced many relevant tweets, both false positives (eg, mistakenly keeping a tweet that refers to long haul in the context of transportation) and false negatives (eg, mistakenly discarding a relevant tweet because it lacks or has a typo in a target hashtag or keyword) can occur. False positives could be reduced by checking for the context surrounding a match, for example, excluding tweets that refer to long-haul flights. False negatives could be reduced using advanced semantic language models beyond keyword matching, for example, classifying clinical tweets versus those that are not.
Additionally, concerning the data quality, this study lacks the ability to verify the genuineness and authenticity of users’ posts on social media. Ensuring the authenticity of users is a crucial aspect of using social media to provide insights into public health. Some potential strategies to improve the quality of social media content and exclude fake accounts and bots include implementing account verification processes, monitoring user behavior for suspicious activity, and using available ML models built to identify fraudulent activities.
Best Practices and Future Directions

Overview In this section, we would like to explain the best practices for researchers and developers interested in applying NLP to social media to facilitate information extraction tasks.

Generalizable Models UmlsBERT is a transformer-based contextual model with better generalizability and reliability than traditional entity extraction models. However, in our experiments we found that these models may overfit to occurrences of specific tokens such as vid. As a result, at inference time, incorrect tokens may be captured. A simple solution to extend the capabilities of these models is by looking at the frequencies of captured tokens and devising simple rules to correct the errors. A simple rule-based strategy should also remove variations of the same frequently occurring tokens. Another potential solution for this task would be using symptom ontology and standard normalization procedures to facilitate comparisons between variations of the same token. Literature references and ground truths can also be referred to for this procedure, especially in the case of new illnesses wherein ontologies may not fully capture the experiences that patients are trying to express—for example, brain fog.

Longitudinal Analysis Providing a longitudinal analysis of posts from the same user will enable better characterization of the evolution of symptoms over time. However, it is essential to note that this might pose challenges for ensuring privacy as, for example, the combination of posts may increase the possibility of reidentifying a user. In addition, aggregating their posts may infer illness in patients who have not consented to such an assessment

"Clinical phenotypes and quality of life to define post-COVID-19 syndrome: a cluster analysis of the multinational, prospective ORCHESTRA cohort
","Background: Lack of specific definitions of clinical characteristics, disease severity, and risk and preventive factors of post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) severely impacts research and discovery of new preventive and therapeutics drugs.
Methods: This prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from February 2020 to June 2022 in 5 countries, enrolling SARS-CoV-2 out- and in-patients followed at 3-, 6-, and 12-month from diagnosis, with assessment of clinical and biochemical features, antibody (Ab) response, Variant of Concern (VoC), and physical and mental quality of life (QoL). Outcome of interest was identification of risk and protective factors of PCS by clinical phenotype, setting, severity of disease, treatment, and vaccination status. We used SF-36 questionnaire to assess evolution in QoL index during follow-up and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (principal component analysis, PCA) to explore symptom clusters. Severity of PCS was defined by clinical phenotype and QoL. We also used generalized linear models to analyse the impact of PCS on QoL and associated risk and preventive factors. CT registration number: NCT05097677.
Findings: Among 1796 patients enrolled, 1030 (57%) suffered from at least one symptom at 12-month. PCA identified 4 clinical phenotypes: chronic fatigue-like syndrome (CFs: fatigue, headache and memory loss, 757 patients, 42%), respiratory syndrome (REs: cough and dyspnoea, 502, 23%); chronic pain syndrome (CPs: arthralgia and myalgia, 399, 22%); and neurosensorial syndrome (NSs: alteration in taste and smell, 197, 11%). Determinants of clinical phenotypes were different (all comparisons p < 0.05): being female increased risk of CPs, NSs, and CFs; chronic pulmonary diseases of REs; neurological symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of REs, NSs, and CFs; oxygen therapy of CFs and REs; and gastrointestinal symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of CFs. Early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with monoclonal Ab (all clinical phenotypes), corticosteroids therapy for mild/severe cases (NSs), and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (CPs) were less likely to be associated to PCS (all comparisons p < 0.05). Highest reduction in QoL was detected in REs and CPs (43.57 and 43.86 vs 57.32 in PCS-negative controls, p < 0.001). Female sex (p < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.034) and renal complications (p = 0.002) during the acute infection were likely to increase risk of severe PCS (QoL <50). Vaccination and early treatment with monoclonal Ab reduced the risk of severe PCS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively).
Interpretation: Our study provides new evidence suggesting that PCS can be classified by clinical phenotypes with different impact on QoL, underlying possible different pathogenic mechanisms. We identified factors associated to each clinical phenotype and to severe PCS. These results might help in designing pathogenesis studies and in selecting high-risk patients for inclusion in therapeutic and management clinical trials.
","Given the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide, we expect an increasing demand for long-term follow-up and support, affecting productivity, public health, and society.19 Understanding this multidimensional clinical condition is key to implementing effective preventive measures and most importantly to inform the currently empty pipeline for new treatments. The ORCHESTRA project focused on a prospective long-term data collection of SARS-CoV-2 in- and out-patients up to one year from diagnosis of acute infection, assessing clinical presentation, VoC, serological response, biochemical parameters, and QoL in order to improve accuracy of the PCS definition. Our data confirm that PCS cannot be considered a unique clinical entity, but that it can be differentiated in clinical phenotypes which are likely to have different mechanisms of pathogenesis and therefore different associated factors.9,10 Our results also show that the impact of the four identified clinical phenotypes on QoL is different and the assessment of risk factors, based only on nonspecific single symptom, could severely undermine the correct identification of risk and preventive factors. Comparing the analysis of risk factors between WHO definition of PCS3 and the newly identified clinical phenotypes, we showed that some risk factors were not previously identified (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis) while others (e.g., neurological symptoms) seem to be strongly linked with specific clinical phenotypes. The same applies to the assessment of factors likely to decrease the risk of developing the outcomes. The analysis identified not only novel factors associated to a decreased risk to develop PCS (e.g., corticosteroid therapy during the acute phase of COVID-19) but also showed negative associations as SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and chronic fatigue syndrome. Using the criteria of presence of at least one symptom to define the PCS would underestimate the burden of disease in severe cases, thereby limiting the development of specific intensive and multidisciplinary management protocols for these patients.
Although a few studies showed that the PCS includes different clusters of symptom,20 risk and preventive factors by cluster have been not yet identified in a large, multicenter prospective cohort. The ORCHESTRA data support that several patient-related factors and acute infection features are associated with a higher probability of developing PCS and show that clinical phenotypes have different impact on QoL. The higher discrimination power achieved by the cluster analysis compared to the conventional logistic regression applying the WHO definition of PCS, confirms the accuracy of results, especially for the neurosensorial and chronic pain phenotypes. By combining clinical phenotypes and QoL we also propose the first definition, to the best of our knowledge, of severe PCS as a combination of three symptom clusters with highest impact on QoL, in particular on the physical component. Female sex, gastrointestinal symptoms and renal complications during the acute infection were associated with a higher risk of developing severe PCS, while vaccination and early treatment for SARS-CoV-2 were inversely associated to the outcome.
Consistently with the previous reports,21 our cohort showed a higher proportion of post-COVID-19 syndrome among females of reproductive age. Women elicit a stronger humoral and cellular immune response compared to men. Sex hormones and genetic factors have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for these differences,22 and could also explain the female prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome in adults. Pre-existing chronic pulmonary diseases increase the risk of the respiratory clinical phenotype of PCS.23 Several mechanisms could increase SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in chronic pulmonary diseases, including apoptosis and epithelial damage in the airway.24 As for the risk of PCS, the coexistence of both diseases could possibly multiply their effects with substantial impact on QoL and physical activity.
Neurological symptoms are common in PCS. In a cohort study of 154,068 individuals with COVID-19, there was increased risk of neurologic sequelae with a hazard ratio of 1.42 and burden of 70.69 per 1000 individuals at 12-month follow-up post-acute infection. The risk was high also in individuals not requiring hospitalization.25 Most probable mechanisms may involve activation of microglia and astrocytes, disturbances in synaptic signalling of upper-layer excitatory neurons, and impaired neurogenesis.25 Our study substantially adds to the existing evidence suggesting that neurological symptoms during acute infection increase the risk not only, as expected, of the neurological clinical phenotype, but also the respiratory and the chronic fatigue-like clinical phenotypes, suggesting that these clinical phenotypes may share the same pathogenetic mechanisms.
Our analysis suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms at acute phase increases the risk of the chronic fatigue clinical phenotype. Alteration of microbiome, reported in patients with PCS six months after diagnosis of acute infection, may be responsible for the persistence of symptoms. It is possible to hypothesize that changes in the intestinal microbiome could increase the risk of persistent fatigue inducing a long-term pro-inflammatory status as demonstrated for neuropsychiatric, metabolic, and autoimmune diseases.26
A very recent systematic review analysed 16 observational studies from five countries assessing the effect of vaccination on development of PCS. Ten studies showed a significant reduction in the incidence with an effect increased by number of dosages. Major limitation of included studies was the lack of adjustment for potential confounders.27 Analysis of our cohort shows that vaccination (any number of doses, and either before or after infection) independently reduces the risk of the chronic pain clinical phenotype of the PCS. The benefit of vaccination may be explained by enhanced clearance of persistent virus or nonspecific immunomodulation, which may reduce the possible inflammatory drivers of the post-COVID-19 syndrome.28
The impact of treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 on the incidence of PCS is still an open question. We observed that corticosteroids administration during the acute infection reduced the risk of developing the neurological clinical phenotype, thus suggesting a possible role of acute inflammation in the pathogenesis of post-COVID neurosensorial impairment. Early therapy with anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies in high-risk patients has been shown to be effective at preventing progression to severe disease, hospitalization, and death.29 Our cohort provides the first evidence that early treatment with monoclonal antibodies decreases all clinical phenotypes of PCS 12 months after treatment. It is possible to hypothesize that the reduction of viral persistence in tissue and of viral mimicry (and indirectly duration of symptoms) could contribute to the reduction of risk of PCS. However, generalisability of these results should be interpreted with caution, given that the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies is strictly related to the type, virulence, and drug sensitivity of VoC.
The impact of COVID-19 on QoL has been assessed through different studies and highly heterogeneous set of tools and time points. A recent European Respiratory Society statement on long COVID follow-up, underlined a lack of consistency in the selection of instruments to measure QoL among studies.30 The strength of our cohort is the assessment of both in- and out-patients using the same tool at the same time points. Interestingly, being hospitalized was independently associated with a worse performance on physical activity but did not impact the mental component. QoL analysis by clinical phenotypes allowed us to stratify the PCS by severity, providing a new insight into PCS research and relevant information when developing post COVID management plans.
Limitations of our study are the high proportion of patients hospitalised vs community managed patients, reflecting that the majority of patients were enrolled from the first and second waves. However, the ORCHESTRA cohort includes also a proportion of outpatients, allowing for comparisons according to patients’ settings. Although we had a specific protocol for symptoms assessment and expert personnel prospectively assessed patients, we cannot exclude a slight overestimation of PCS, being some of the symptoms as asthenia, difficult to objectively measure it, in case the symptom was already reported before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although early therapy of acute infection is confirmed in all analyses as a factor associated with a lower risk of PCS, treatment includes only monoclonal antibodies, and the role of oral antivirals (i.e., nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupinavir), being available at later stage, could not be assessed. Worthy of note, the recommendation for using monoclonal antibodies by national and international stakeholders, was limited to patients at high risk for progression of disease so their role in preventing PCS in young population could not be analysed. The analysis of VoC in our cohort is limited, although results resembles the distribution of VoC observed in Europe during the study period. Substantial changes in virulence of new VoC could impact PCS symptoms and its incidence. Finally, it has to be noticed that large sample size may impact statistical significance, so that even small or modest effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios) appear statistically significant. We are confident, however, that our study substantially adds to the ongoing discussion on the definition of PCS. Major strengths of our study are the use of a multinational prospective cohort adopting the same protocol, the inclusion of immunological and biochemical tests, and the contemporary correlation with QoL.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a new clinical classification of the PCS and its severity based on clinical presentation at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, patients’ epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and impact of defined clinical phenotypes on QoL. Our study provides evidence that the PCS has various clinical presentations, likely driven by multiple mechanisms, and with different impact on QoL. Early identification of patients at risk of PCS, at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, could be used to facilitate the enrolment in new developed management protocols for follow-up in dedicated out-patient clinic just after diagnosis and drive inclusion of patients at risk for severe PCS in clinical trials for new treatment. The definition of clinical clusters could also support comparative analyses among different European and non-European cohorts and the process of data homogenisation which plays as essential role in country pandemic plans. The role of early therapy and vaccination in reducing all or some specific clinical phenotypes further support vaccination campaigns and new studies on the role of antivirals and early treatment in patients with no comorbidities are needed. There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic comes to a close, the number of individuals suffering in the years to come from PCS, ethically does not allow us to curtail basic and clinical research in this field.

"Diabetic post-covid mucormycosis: A dermatoglyphic prediction
","Aim:
To identify the characteristic pattern/parameter among diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients which may further help in identifying such susceptible patients in a much earlier course of the disease.
Materials and Methods:
The study was done with 30 diabetic patients (21 males and 9 females) admitted in RIMS Ranchi during the second wave of Covid-19 for post-covid complications. Palm and fingerprint pattern was taken by ink and pad method to measure the qualitative and quantitative parameters.
Result:
Diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients were found to have predominantly whorl pattern in males, loop in females, and C-line pattern absent in 36.6%. Proximal axial triradii with ulnar deviation was 76.6%. All the ridge counts (except ab ridge count of right hand) when compared with hypothesized value were found to be significant with P value (<0.005). None of the three angles measured were found to be significant.
Conclusion:
All the ridge counts (except ab ridge count of right hand) were found to be a reliable parameter for the diagnosis of diabetic post-covid mucormycosis. ATD angle known to be the most reliable parameter for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in dermatoglyphics is found to be nonreliable with respect to diabetes post-covid mucormycosis.
","Qualitative parameters

Fingerprint: In the present study whorl pattern (48.54%) in males and loop (51.12%) in females was found to be more common in diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients as shown in [Figure 1]. This finding was found similar to Praveen Ojha et al. (2014)[11] and Rakate et al. (2013)[12] who observed a similar trend among diabetic patients. Hence there is no difference in fingerprint predominance pattern between the diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients and diabetic patients. Figure 1 Exhibiting distribution of the fingerprint pattern among gender   
C-line pattern, axial triradii (AXT), and axial triradii deviation (AXT-d): C-line pattern was found to be radial in 42% of diabetic patients in the study by Praveen Ojha et al.[11] but in our study, the predominant pattern in diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients was absent C-line 36.6% followed by ulnar (26.6%), radial (21.6%), and proximal (13.3%). The association was not found to be significant between diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients and diabetic patients. The commonest AXT pattern was found to be proximal variety consistent with the findings of diabetic patients in the study by Praveen Ojha et al.[11] but the finding was not significant. AXT-d was found to be ulnar deviated in 76.7% of diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients compared to radial deviation being the most common in the diabetic patients in the study by Praveen Ojha et al.[11]

Quantitative parameters

Total finger ridge count (TFRC) and Average finger ridge count (AFRC) In the present study mean TFRC and mean AFRC were 58.28 ± 12.44 and 61.10 ± 11.95. On running the statistical analysis P value (<0.005) was found to be highly significant thus showing the importance of TFRC and AFRC in diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients compared to hypothesized values of diabetic patients.
ab ridge count, bc ridge count, and cd ridge count. Mean ab ridge count (left) 38.3 ± 6.89, mean bc ridge count (right and left) 26.17 ± 5.97 and 25.57 ± 5.41, respectively, and mean cd ridge count (right and left) was 35.63 ± 5.46 and 31.93 ± 7.92, respectively, P value (<0.005) was found to be highly significant thus showing the importance of the three ridge counts in diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients.
ATD angle, ADT angle, and DAT angle ADT angle is known to be a reliable indicator for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in the previous researches.[13,14] In my study mean ATD angle, mean ADT angle, and mean DAT angle were 40.74°, 79.01°, and 43.3°, respectively. The mean of all the angles was falling in the range of previous studies done on diabetic patients, hence, it was not significant statistically with respect to diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients, this shows that angles are not a very reliable parameter for its diagnosis.

Conclusion
The present study aimed to find out if there is any dermatoglyphic parameter in diabetic post-covid patients which will help as a predictor for mucormycosis susceptibility among these patients and help in its early diagnosis. The findings are summed up as under

AXT-d was more on the ulnar side and absent C-line which was most common was found in 36.6% of diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients
TFRC, AFRC, ab ridge count (left), bc ridge count (right and left), and cd ridge count (right and left) were found statistically significant. Indicating them to be a reliable parameter for the diagnosis of diabetic post-covid mucormycosis
According to literature ATD angle known to be the most reliable parameter for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in dermatoglyphics is found to be nonsignificant with respect to post-covid mucormycosis.

This study will offer diabetic patients in the covid era, prediction guidance so that they can be timely informed about the likelihood of developing mucormycosis and take the appropriate precautions to prevent it.
In developing nations like India, where the primary health care must be delivered with very few resources in primary level health care facilities, the non-invasive method will be of immense help.
Limitation of the study
This study was done with a limited number of patients in a single tertiary care hospital.
Relevance of the study to the practice of primary care physicians

This study is conducted using dermatoglyphic as a research parameter.
Dermatoglyphic is a non-invasive test that can be done in OPD or inpatient, primary, secondary, or tertiary health care facilities.
Dermatoglyphic can be done with minimal workforce training in a resource-limited setup.
The study gives information about predicting disease severity and mortality which can be used to create awareness among the vulnerable group, that is, the diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patients.

Henceforth, dermatoglyphic, and the parameters derived through it, can aid in diabetic post-covid mucormycosis patient triaging at the primary assessment.

"Early Prediction and HRCT Evaluation of Post Covid-19 Related Lung Fibrosis
","Background:
Early detection of post-COVID-19-related lung fibrosis is very important for the early introduction of treatment and to minimize morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is the early detection and evaluation of post-COVID-19 fibrosis by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
Methods:
This prospective study included 115 patients irrespective of age and sex, who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab (RT PCR), admitted to the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) dedicated COVID-19 hospital, Dhaka, and discharged after recovery. Patients went through a chest HRCT scan at least once during their hospital stay and another scan during follow-up after hospital discharge and 8 to 12 weeks of negative RT-PCR report.
Result:
Among 100 patients 23 patients had >50% of total lung involvement by visual assessment. Thirty-three patients had 25% to 50% of total lung volume involvement. Twenty-seven patients had less than 25% of total lung involvement, whereas 17 patients had no visual fibrotic change on the follow-up HRCT scan. A statistical association was found between age, gender, smoking, and severe form of lung fibrosis (P < .05). Patients with mild CT severity score (⩽8) had a very good prognosis. Patients who were admitted to the hospital for more than 15 days were more prone to developing moderate and severe forms of fibrosis. Patients who received at least 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had less severe forms of fibrosis as well as more cases of complete radiological recovery. On the HRCT scan, most of the patients had bilateral, peripheral (68%), and predominant mid & lower lobar parenchymal involvement.
Conclusion:
Early detection and HRCT evaluation of post-COVID-19 related lung fibrosis is very crucial for early management and introduction of anti-fibrotic drugs.
","More than 50% of the patients (n = 58) were more than 60 years old in our study (Figure 2). Among them, 34.5% (n = 20) of patients had more than 50% of lung involvement. 39.7% (n = 23) patients had 25% to 50% of lung involvement and 19% (n = 11) patients had less than 25% of lung involvement (Figure 2). Whereas, among 58 patients only 6.9% (n = 4) patients had total recovery (no fibrosis) (Figure 2). This data correlates with other studies conducted elsewhere, where researchers found that older patients are more prone to developing fibrosis.15,16 This is largely because older people have underlying medical conditions and weakened immune systems that act as catalysts for severe COVID-19 disease.15,16
We found that patients below 40 years of age had no severe case of fibrosis and out of 9 patients 5 (55.6%) had complete radiological recovery. We also noted that maximum patients of the 40 to 60 year age group had mild (13 out of 33) and moderate (9 out of 33) lung involvement and a significant number of patients (n = 8) recovered completely from COVID-19 pneumonia. This is in line with findings from other studies and anecdotal evidence where young people were found to be less susceptible to COVID-19 complications.15,16
Among 62 male patients 29% (n = 18) patients had severe (more than 50%) parenchymal fibrotic change in contrast to female patients who had only 13.2% (5 out of 38) of severe form of fibrosis. We observed that a significant number of female patients had mild form (less than 25%) of fibrosis (16 out of 38) and complete radiological recovery (11 out of 38) in comparison to male patients (11 and 6 respectively out of 62 patients). Twenty-seven male patients out of 62 had 25% to 50% parenchymal fibrotic(moderate) changes which are significantly higher than female patients (6 out of 38). This may be due to the androgenic effect which promotes the transcription of transmembrane protease, the serine 2 gene that encoded protein primes the spike protein of SARS-Cov-2. This impairs antibody response and facilitates the interaction of the virus and host cells. 17
In our study, about 46% (13 out of 28) of smokers developed a severe form of fibrosis which is significantly higher than nonsmoker patients (about 13%). We also observed that a significant percentage of nonsmoker patients had complete recovery (20.8%) and mild form of parenchymal fibrosis (31.9%) in comparison to smokers (7.1% and 14.3% respectively). Other researchers also found similar types of data in their studies, where the odds of developing fibrosis were higher among smokers compared to non-smokers.15,18
CT severity score is an important factor for the prediction of post-COVID-19 pneumonia-related lung fibrosis. In this study, we found that patients with mild CT severity score (⩽8) had very good prognoses as 83% (15 out of 18) patients showed no sign of fibrosis in follow-up HRCT scans. However, 3 out of 18 patients had a mild form of fibrosis. We noted that a significant number of patients with severe CT severity scores (⩾15) developed moderate (20 out of 48) and severe (21 out of 48) forms of fibrosis in follow-up scans and none had complete recovery. Most of the patients with CT severity scores of 9 to 14 developed mild (50%) and moderate (38%) forms of fibrosis. Our data is supported by other studies where it was shown that CT severity score is correlated to COVID-19 outcome and long-term complications.15,19
In this study, we found that number of days of hospital stay of the patients is directly proportional to the severity of fibrosis. Patients who were admitted to the hospital for more than 15 days were more prone to developing moderate (17 out of 39) and severe (17 out of 39) forms of fibrosis. On the other hand, 56% (n = 14) patients had a complete radiological recovery, and 24% (n = 6) patients had a mild form of fibrosis and had less than 5 days of hospital stay. Whereas the patients who were admitted for 5 to 15 days into the hospital had mostly mild (47.2%) and moderate (30.6%) forms of fibrosis.
In their study, Rahman et al 20 showed that vaccination can significantly reduce the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia both radiologically and clinically. In our study, we observed that patients who received at least 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had less severe forms of fibrosis as well as more cases of complete radiological recovery. Out of 79 patients 14 (17.7%) patients had no sign of fibrosis in the follow-up scan. However, this data is not statistically significant as 14.2% of patients had also complete radiological recovery among 21 non-vaccinated/single-dose vaccinated patients. However, the percentage of severe forms of fibrosis is about twice as in non-vaccinated/single dose vaccinated patients (42.8%) than in completely vaccinated patients (17.7%). We also noted that a significant percentage (31.6%) of completely vaccinated patients had a milder form of fibrosis than the other group (9.5%).
There are several limitations to this study. First, the sample numbers were low compared to the number of positive cases diagnosed. This is because many patients were lost to follow-up and the researchers did not have the resources to contact all the patients after discharge from the hospital. Next, the evaluation of COVID-19 fibrosis is dependent on physicians’ judgment. Hence, there is the risk of bias there even though the researchers tried to mitigate this issue by involving several physicians at each step of evaluation.

"Circulating anti-nuclear autoantibodies in COVID-19 survivors predict long COVID symptoms
Circulating anti-nuclear autoantibodies in COVID-19 survivors predict long COVID symptoms
","Background: Autoimmunity has been reported in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated whether anti-nuclear/extractable-nuclear antibodies (ANAs/ENAs) were present up to a year after infection, and if they were associated with the development of clinically relevant post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms.
Methods: A rapid-assessment line immunoassay was used to measure circulating levels of ANAs/ENAs in 106 convalescent COVID-19 patients with varying acute phase severities at 3, 6 and 12 months post-recovery. Patient-reported fatigue, cough and dyspnoea were recorded at each time point. Multivariable logistic regression model and receiver operating curves were used to test the association of autoantibodies with patient-reported outcomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Results: Compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=22) and those who had other respiratory infections (n=34), patients with COVID-19 had higher detectable ANAs at 3 months post-recovery (p<0.001). The mean number of ANA autoreactivities per individual decreased between 3 and 12 months (from 3.99 to 1.55) with persistent positive titres associated with fatigue, dyspnoea and cough severity. Antibodies to U1-snRNP and anti-SS-B/La were both positively associated with persistent symptoms of fatigue (p<0.028, area under the curve (AUC) 0.86) and dyspnoea (p<0.003, AUC=0.81). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and C-reactive protein predicted the elevated ANAs at 12 months. TNF-α, D-dimer and interleukin-1β had the strongest association with symptoms at 12 months. Regression analysis showed that TNF-α predicted fatigue (β=4.65, p=0.004) and general symptomaticity (β=2.40, p=0.03) at 12 months.
Interpretation: Persistently positive ANAs at 12 months post-COVID are associated with persisting symptoms and inflammation (TNF-α) in a subset of COVID-19 survivors. This finding indicates the need for further investigation into the role of autoimmunity in PASC.
","We comprehensively profiled autoantibody signatures of 18 clinically relevant ANA/ENAs in 106 convalescent COVID-19 patients at 3, 6, and 12 months post-recovery. First, we demonstrated COVID-19 survivors had elevated levels of circulating ANA/ENAs compared to the healthy and non-COVID infection groups at 3 months post-recovery. Amongst the COVID19 survivors, the number of ANA/ENA reactivities at 3 months post-recovery proportionally increased with the severity of the patient’s acute phase infection; however, this correlation was absent at later time points. Second, high titers of circulating ANA/ENAs were maintained up to 6 months post-recovery but were significantly attenuated by 12 months. Albeit several pathogenic ANA/ENAs are still detectable in up to 30% of COVID survivors at 12 months. Further, for 12% of post-COVID patients, positive ANA/ENAs were observed at 12 months afresh, that were otherwise below the cut-off threshold at 3/6 month time-point, underlining potential de novo autoantibody synthesis. Two of the most prevalent autoantibodies, anti-U1-snRNP and anti-SSB/La, positively predict both persisting fatigue and dyspnea symptoms in COVID-19 survivors. Finally, we demonstrated that TNFα, a key cytokine associated with development/sustenance of autoimmune diseases, positively predicted the observed ANA/ENAs as well as symptom scores at 12 months, post-recovery. Taken together, we provide evidence of an ongoing autoimmune inflammation marked by detectable circulating ANA/ENAs and elevated TNFα, that are associated with persisting symptoms at 12 months post-recovery in individuals who were otherwise healthy before contracting COVID-19. Although previous work has demonstrated the persistence of autoantibodies in post-COVID individuals[14, 18-21], to our knowledge, the current study is the first to track specific autoantibodies with confirmed/known clinical pathogenicity with commonly reported long COVID symptoms across three timepoints up to one-year post-recovery. Transient increases in autoantibodies in response to viral infections is commonly seen in weeks following recovery, however, these generally resolve[22]. Consistent with this, there was a significant reduction in the mean autoreactivities at 12 months in our post-COVID cohort for most autoantigens. That said, several ANA/ENAs remained detectable despite their statistically significant attenuation in some post-COVID patients, such as anti-U1-snRNP (30%), anti-SS-B/La (21%), and anti-PMScl (21%). Whether this is a harbinger of future autoimmunity is not known, but elevated antiribonucleoprotein and anti-SS autoantibodies after viral infections (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus) are associated with the development of rheumatological diagnosis [23-25]. In fact, a number of cases of new-onset autoimmune diseases post-COVID have been reported including vasculitis[26, 27], arthritis[28], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)[29], and myositis[30] in patients with no prior history of autoimmunity, irrespective of acute phase severity[31-34]. COVID-19 patients appear to have slower resolution of inflammation as evidenced by elevated IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα, and this delay in resolution has been hypothesized to contribute to the development of PASC symptoms [7, 35, 36]. Indeed, TNFα has been linked to fatigue in various diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, an incomplete mitigation of autoimmune responses/self-reactivities along with endothelial dysfunction (evident by elevated D-dimer) and residual T1 inflammation may potentially streamline the trajectory towards persisting constitutional symptoms, chronic PASC and eventual development of rheumatological complications. In a systemic review and meta-analysis conducted in January 2021, fatigue (58%) and dyspnea (24%) were included within the five most common developed long-term symptom in over 47,000 post-COVID patients [1]. We acknowledge that we did not comprehensively record all currently known long-COVID symptoms, and may have missed a subset of patients presenting with symptoms not included in the current study (e.g. joint pain, rashes, neurocognitive dysfunction). A significant subset of the patients was recruited at the early phase of the pandemic (Aug. 2020) through patient referrals, community outreach, and hospital recruitment; therefore, a confirmed PASC diagnosis could not be made as per the current guidelines. Symptomaticity, objectively measured, may fluctuate over time for an individual, and subject to recall bias. Hence, we have refrained from calling these patients to have confirmed PASC and aligned our analysis and conclusion with symptomaticity rather than PASC diagnosis. A few limitations of our study merit consideration. First, given the study’s focus on longitudinal observations, it would have been ideal to collect samples and symptoms from our non-COVID infection control cohort at matching 6- and 12-months post-infection timepoints, similar to our post-COVID-19 population. The ever-changing pandemic landscape made it logistically difficult to allow the longitudinal recruitment of the non-COVID-19 participants. The reluctance of nonCOVID-19 participants (infection control and healthy cohorts) to come into the hospital during the pandemic impacted study recruitment. Indeed, though we managed an age-sex matched cohort for the healthy participants, we could not do so for the infection control group. In addition, this mismatch was further impaired by the exclusion of five PCR-negative older individuals due to pre-existing rheumatological complications. A more proportional comparison including adequate hospitalized and ICU-admitted controls would shed more light on whether the development of autoantibodies is specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to a general pathogenicity associated with severe viral infection. In addition, our convalescent COVID-19 patient sample size at 12 months totaled 58 patients, compared to 106 patients at 3 months and 98 patients at 6 months. We surmise that an increased attrition rate at later timepoints may be due to alleviated symptoms in study participants, leading to an enriched, symptomatic population at 12 months. A balanced ratio of samples between timepoints could result in better statistical power for detecting relevant associations between output variables. However, given the topical scenario we found merit in reporting our observations promptly. Finally, as we do not have prepandemic ANA values, we are currently unable to assess if the observed autoimmunity was prevalent pre-COVID, and whether causality exists with the observed symptoms. Though this is currently beyond the scope of the present study, a mechanistic investigation is underway in our ongoing longitudinal long-COVID trial (NCT05459506). In summary, anti-nuclear/extractable nuclear antibodies with known roles in autoimmune diseases were detected at elevated levels in patients at 3 and 6 months post-COVID. Attenuation in the frequency of these autoreactivities was observed by 12 months, despite anti-U1-snRNP and anti-SS-B/La antibodies remained prevalent in up to 30% of post-COVID patients. These autoreactivities strongly correlate with TNFα, and both positively predicts common PASC symptoms one year post-infection. The incomplete attenuation of clinically relevant autoreactivities 12 months post-COVID in one third of patients, associated with persisting symptoms and residual inflammation warrant long-term investigation of autoimmunity in PASC patients.",,,
"Age, Sex and Previous Comorbidities as Risk Factors Not Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection for Long COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
","Identification of predictors of long COVID-19 is essential for managing healthcare plans of patients. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis aimed to identify risk factors not associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but rather potentially predictive of the development of long COVID-19. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers were screened through 15 September 2022. Peer-reviewed studies or preprints evaluating potential pre-SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors for the development of long-lasting symptoms were included. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPSs) tool. Random-effects meta-analyses with calculation of odds ratio (OR) were performed in those risk factors where a homogenous long COVID-19 definition was used. From 1978 studies identified, 37 peer-reviewed studies and one preprint were included. Eighteen articles evaluated age, sixteen articles evaluated sex, and twelve evaluated medical comorbidities as risk factors of long COVID-19. Overall, single studies reported that old age seems to be associated with long COVID-19 symptoms (n = 18); however, the meta-analysis did not reveal an association between old age and long COVID-19 (n = 3; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.03, p = 0.17). Similarly, single studies revealed that female sex was associated with long COVID-19 symptoms (n = 16); which was confirmed in the meta-analysis (n = 7; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.86, p = 0.01). Finally, medical comorbidities such as pulmonary disease (n = 4), diabetes (n = 1), obesity (n = 6), and organ transplantation (n = 1) were also identified as potential risk factors for long COVID-19. The risk of bias of most studies (71%, n = 27/38) was moderate or high. In conclusion, pooled evidence did not support an association between advancing age and long COVID-19 but supported that female sex is a risk factor for long COVID-19. Long COVID-19 was also associated with some previous medical comorbidities.","This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association of long COVID-19 with risk factors not directly related to an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., pre-infection factors), including age, sex, or previous comorbidities. The results support that female sex may be a predictor of long COVID-19 while old age was reported to be associated with long COVID-19 in single studies; however, the pooled evidence was not significant. Finally, prior medical comorbidities can also be potential predictors of long COVID-19 symptoms. These results should be considered with caution because most studies exhibited moderate to high risk of bias.
4.1. Old Age and Long COVID-19
Old age is an important risk factor of poor outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalization [64]; however, the impact of age on long COVID-19 is controversial. Old age is associated with higher risk of long COVID-19 symptomatology in single studies and in two previous reviews [10,12], but not in the meta-analysis by Maglietta et al. [11]. Results from our qualitative analysis suggest that older adults can develop more long COVID-19 symptoms than younger adults; however, this assumption was not supported when pooling data into a meta-analysis. We conducted two meta-analyses, the first one categorizing those adults older than 60 years (Figure 2), and a second one considering age as a continuous variable (Figure 3); neither analysis revealed an association between old age and risk of developing long COVID-19. Nevertheless, the number of studies pooled in our analyses of age was notably limited (n = 3). Our data are consistent with the meta-analysis of Maglietta et al. [11] but disagree with Thompson et al. [12]. Several differences can explain the discrepancy with Thompson et al. [12]. It is possible that the use of a different definition of long COVID-19 by these authors [12] can lead to inconclusive comparisons of results. In addition, Thompson et al. [12] did not pool data of age and long COVID-19 into a meta-analysis, but only calculated regression of proportions of subjects at each age group developing long COVID-19 symptoms. The significance of old age as a risk factor for long COVID-19 development requires further investigation. In fact, just three out of eighteen papers (16%) analyzing age as prognostic factor showed low risk of bias. The most significant bias of these studies was the proper control of other cofounding factors observed in older people, i.e., higher presence of medical comorbidities, or longer hospitalization stay, which can also be associated with long COVID-19.
4.2. Female Sex and Long COVID-19
Sex is another important risk factor which has been studied in relation to COVID-19 and long COVID-19. Evidence supports that men and women exhibit the same probability of being infected by SARS-CoV-2; however, males are at a higher risk of worse outcomes and death than females during the acute phase of infection [65]. Results from our systematic review and meta-analysis support that female sex may be associated with higher risk of developing long COVID-19 (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.86). Our results are similar to those previously observed by Maglietta et al. [11], who also reported that female sex was associated with long COVID-19 symptoms (OR1.52, 95% CI 1.27–1.82), and with results (OR1.60, 95% CI 1.23–2.07) previously reported by Thompson et al. [12]. Based on available data, females are more vulnerable to develop long COVID-19 than males. Hence, considering sex differences in diagnosis, prevention and treatment are necessary, and fundamental steps towards precision medicine in COVID-19 [66]. Biological (i.e., hormones and immune responses), and sociocultural (i.e., sanitary-related behaviors, psychological stress, and inactivity) aspects play a significant role in creating sex-differences in long COVID-19 symptoms [48], although mechanisms behind increased risk of long COVID-19 in females remain unknown and warrant investigation.
4.3. Medical Comorbidities and Long COVID-19
Such as with old age, the presence of prior medical comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiovascular disease) is known to induce a more severe COVID-19 disease progression [67,68]. A potential reason is that such comorbidities can contribute to degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses this receptor as entry pathway in host cells, higher degradation of ACE2 could lead to a long-lasting inflammatory cytokine storm, oxidative stress, and hemostasis activation, which are all hallmarks of severe/critical COVID-19 illness [69]. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is not yet supported by the literature.
The current qualitative analysis suggests that prior comorbidities may contribute the risk of developing long COVID-19. Among different comorbidities, obesity seems to be associated; however, this assumption should be considered with caution at this stage, since potential cofounding factors, particularly those related to hospitalization (obese patients have more severe COVID-19 disease and higher hospitalization rates than non-obese patients), were not properly controlled in these studies. Moreover, the association of long COVID-19 with other medical comorbidities such as diabetes or transplants was only investigated in one prior study.
4.4. Strengths and Limitations
The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis should be considered according to potential strengths and limitations. Among the strengths, we conducted a systematic search of all the currently available evidence on factor not related to an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but associated with higher risk of developing long COVID-19. This led to identification of thirty-eight studies. Second, this is the first time that several medical comorbidities have been systematically investigated as risk factors of long COVID-19.
One of the limitations is the lack of a consistent definition of long COVID-19 in available literatures. We included all identified studies within the qualitative analysis, but only those using the definition by Soriano et al. [2] of long COVID-19 were included in the meta-analyses. This assumption led to a small number of studies in the meta-analyses. Future studies using a more consistent definition of long COVID-19 are needed for improved quantification of the results. Another limitation is the lack of differentiation of risk factors between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Similarly, no study investigating risk factors considered the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Therefore, studies identifying long COVID-19 risk factors not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection differentiating between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and among different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are now needed. Finally, it should be considered that this systematic review and meta-analysis only investigated risk factors not associated with an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other potential SARS-CoV-2-associated factors, such as severity of disease during the acute phase of infection or the number of COVID-19-associated onset symptoms have also been preliminarily identified as risk factors associated with long COVID-19 symptoms, particularly with respiratory symptoms [11]. Similarly, it is possible that some long COVID-19 symptoms can also be related to hospitalization factors which were also not investigated in this review.

"Post-COVID-19 Stroke Rehabilitation in Qatar: A Retrospective, Observational Pilot Study","Background and purpose: A growing field of interest is exploration of the functional outcomes of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with stroke after rehabilitation. The association between stroke and COVID-19 infection is still being studied. We had explored the functional gain in post-COVID-19 patients with stroke following active rehabilitation services in Qatar to understand the possible predictors of functional gain.
Methods: We had included twenty patients diagnosed with post-COVID-19 with stroke in this retrospective pilot study conducted at a Qatar rehabilitation setting. We had used preexisting data from electronic medical records. We had included the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), post-COVID-19 functional status (PCFS), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) as outcome measures. We had used descriptive statistics to summarize the baseline characteristics. A paired t-test had been used to compare the pre and posttests of the study group at admission and discharge. Multiple regression analyses had been performed to assess the predictors of functional gain, including age, employment status, impaired side, family history, and length of stay (LOS). All the results had been presented with associated 95% confidence intervals.
Results: This study had revealed an increase in functional gain (mean FIM gain, 32.9 ± 8.9) and improvements in functional performance throughout active rehabilitation (LOS, 62.45 ± 37.61). Significant differences had been noted in all outcome measures from admission until discharge (p < 0.05). Age (β = - 0.769, p = 0.022) and impaired side (β = 0.573, p = 0.007) had significantly predicted National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. Age (β = - 0.764, p = 0.047) had been a major factor that significantly predicted FIM gain. LOS (β = - 0.990, p = 0.002) had predicted FAC. The mean age was 56 ± 8 years.
Conclusion: Various factors are independently associated with functional gain after rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that active rehabilitation services and immediate intervention will be required to rehabilitate post-COVID-19 patients with stroke, a vulnerable population, to achieve adequate functional improvement.
","The major findings in this study are: (1) the significant correlation between admission and discharge scores of all outcome measures (p < 0.05) (Table 2); and (2) determining how predictor variables influence outcome measures (Table 3). Age, the impaired side, family history/comorbidities, LOS, employment status, cognition, NIHSS scores were studied to see their influence on the functional gain in patients with post-COVID-19 stroke. Table 2 explains the difference in outcome measures before and after rehabilitation and its significance. Table 3 compares demographics with FIM gain, predicting a significant difference in test scores at admission and discharge.
Improvements in motor and functional status of patients with rehabilitation potential are essential to estimate prognosis and predict rehabilitation goals and self-care independence. 35 This study used FIM as the primary outcome measure to assess functional status. It is a reliable and valid tool for measuring functional capacity and was also one of the predictors of functional gain in long-term stroke survivors. 20 In a recent study by Brown et al., 36 functional independence as measured by FIM scores dominated the prediction of the outcome at discharge. Our study also indicates a significant change in the FIM scores from admission until discharge (Table 2). The total FIM scores at admission and discharge were 62.35 ± 21.84 and 95.30 ± 21.03 points, respectively. The significant improvement in FIM scores (p < 0.05) indicated that most patients were discharged home safely. They were at a level they could manage self-care tasks with minimal assistance to close supervision or by modifying the environment or home according to their abilities. Therefore, since the FIM scores showed a significant difference at admission and discharge, they were defined as an FIM gain. A study by Paolucci et al. 37 also mentioned that better functional recovery is associated with early and prompt rehabilitation. Therefore, early rehabilitation provided by our interdisciplinary team showed positive change and greatly influenced the functionality of patients undergoing rehabilitation.
One study mentioned cognitive status changes of the patients during hospitalization. 38 Also, cognitive impairment seemed to predict and significantly influence FIM in another study. 39 All 20 patients in our study were cognitively intact, although mild disorientation presented temporarily due to the environment or setting change. This is consistent with a study that discusses cognitive limitations after COVID-19 infection, having considerable implications on functional outcomes. 40 The results supported that positive changes in cognitive function occurred and were positively associated with over all functional gain. A minimal but significant change (pretest = 24.35(1.56); posttest = 25.05(1.23);p = 0.015) in the cognitive status of patients was seen, as assessed by the MMSE tool.
Functional status was also measured using the PCFS tool. The PCFS was a recommended new scale that could be used to assess functional residue. 41 Apart from the FIM, the PCFS was used to understand the ultimate consequences of COVID-19 on functional status. A study by Manuel et al. 42 reported that many of them had decreased functional status six months after hospitalization, as measured by the PCFS. Also, age and LOS were factors associated with limitations in functional status, impacting the overall quality of life. The mean PCFS score on admission was 3.55 ± 0.82 (p = 0.045), indicating moderate to severe functional limitations. Inpatients could not perform certain activities that needed to be taken over by others and required assistance in instrumental activities of daily living. With subsequent rehabilitation, the PCFS score was 2.05 ± 1.19 (p = 0.045), assessed at the time of discharge, indicating mild to negligible functional limitations. Patients improved function as they could independently perform all usual activities but at a lower intensity with mild limitations. Therefore, there seemed to be an overall improvement in the functional status of patients after rehabilitation.
Another important clinical feature post-COVID-19 stroke patients experienced was fatigue. Halpin et al. 43 showed that fatigue was one of the most significant symptoms patients experienced 4–8 weeks after hospital discharge. In this study, fatigue was measured using the Borg RPE scale. The positive changes in the Borg RPE scores from admission (2.80 ± 1.64) to discharge (1 ± 0.97) showed that fatigue levels reduced significantly among patients after rehabilitation.
The use of the ARAT on stroke patients was a valid measure and can be used as an appropriate measure in upper extremity rehabilitation, as discussed by Lang et al. 44 Therefore, the ARAT was used in a study of 20 inpatients with significant upper limb dysfunction, ranging from mild to severe. However, with subsequent upper limb rehabilitation, the function improved. The difference between admission (0.55 ± 0.60) and discharge (1.75 ± 1.07) ARAT scores were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The SD is higher than the mean score in the admission ARAT score, which could be because of the high variation in the test scores. Another possibility is that there is a stronger association between the variables. This proved that therapeutic intervention was effective in functionally improving upper limb function.
One other primary functional outcome was functional ambulation, as measured by FAC. A prospective study found that patients with severe COVID-19 infection had poorer exercise tolerance and functional ambulation. 45 This was true in the present study that showed poor tolerance to therapy and limitation in ambulation. The difference between the scores on admission (2.20 ± 1.10) and discharge (4.10 ± 1.48) was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Consistent with previous studies 46 related to stroke patients, age and NIHSS scores were significant predictors of functional gain. In this study, the mean age was 56 ± 8 years. Studies have shown that age alone is a significant factor for COVID-19 and other severe diseases. 47 This supports the current finding in this study, showing that age, among the other variables, was found to influence functional gain positively (p < 0.05). Looking at the predictors of functional gain, only age seemed to influence and predict FIM gain (F(5,14) = 2.110,p = 0.047, R2 = 0.430), as seen in Figures 1 and 
and2.
2. All other variables, including employment status, LOS, side of impairment, and family history, did not show any significance in influencing FIM potential. This could be because the COVID-19 affected older individuals more than younger people, and the younger the individual, the greater the potential for recovery. Therefore, age played an important factor in predicting FIM gain in this study. This is supported by a study by Manuel et al., 42 who also explained that gender, age, hospital LOS, and ICU admission were strongly associated with limitations in functional status. Also, the time from stroke onset to patient admission is positively associated with functional gain. 46 Therefore, patients must get admitted at the earliest for immediate intervention to show significant functional gain along their rehabilitation journey. Studies have shown that the median NIHSS scores were higher in stroke patients with COVID-19 infection than those without COVID-19. This was because the functional outcomes of those with COVID-19 were poorer when compared to those without COVID-19 due to the clinical characteristics and severity of disability caused by COVID-19. 23 This could be seen in our study, with the difference in admission NIHSS scores (9.30 ± 2.45) and discharge scores (8.40 ± 2.41) being statistically significant. As seen in previous studies, 42 the mean NIHSS scores in stroke patients (NIHSS score = 8) is lower when compared to our study results, supporting previous literature. A study among stroke survivors found that age and NIHSS scores at rehabilitation admission were independently associated with FIM gain. 48 This study showed that age was significantly associated with FIM gain, but not with NIHSS scores. This could be due to the heterogeneity of the study population and the combination of stroke and post-COVID-19 clinical characteristics instead of stroke patients only.
Employment status was part of the baseline characteristics studied, as shown in Table 1. COVID-19 shutdowns have had a negative impact on employment and working hours among all groups. 49 Studies have concluded that those who have lost jobs and reemployed had increased risks for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence, 50 causing depression, 51 financial strain, 52 stress, triggering a stroke. In this study, 75% of patients were working, of which 50% were reemployed after a brief period, which is in line with previous studies. 50 As a predictor of functional gain, overall employment status did not affect FIM gain (p = 0.281;p < 0.05). Whether being employed or not, most patients showed significant FIM gain from admission to discharge.
The other major findings of this study were to explore the predictor variables influencing FIM gain. The results show that the age of the participants (Correlation coefficient = − 0.769;p = 0.022) negatively affected NIHSS scores, and the impaired side (Correlation coefficient = 0.573;p = 0.007) positively affected NIHSS scores. Age negatively affected functional independence (Correlation coefficient = − 0.764;p = 0.047). LOS also negatively affected functional ambulation (Correlation coefficient = − 0.990;p = 0.002). Age, employment status, LOS, the impaired side, and family history did not significantly affect the cognition, Borg RPE, PCFS, and ARAT scores. According to a study, 45 , the length of ICU stay was associated with dependent ambulation upon discharge. Since this study was conducted in a rehabilitation setup, the patients received progressive and extensive therapy that improved their ambulation. Therefore, out-of-bed activities must be initiated as soon as the patient is stable regarding saturation and vital parameters, so that functional ambulation can be focused and intervened.
Family history, the impaired side, LOS, employment status, and age did not predict or positively influence cognition, Borg RPE, PCFS, and ARAT scores. This could mean that all these dependent variables (outcome measures) improved and showed positive results at the end of the rehabilitation process irrespective of the predictor variables (age, employment status, LOS, impaired side, and family history/comorbidities). One study mentioned a substantial variance between PCFS and age, gender, and LOS and the presence of any comorbid disorders. 39 However, in the current study, PCFS was not influenced by any predictors. This could be due to the heterogeneity of the group, severity of the stroke, and the small sample size.
The small sample size was a major limitation to effective analysis. 53 Therefore, the limited sample size cannot draw a clear-cut conclusion. However, this study would be one of the first to study post-COVID-19 stroke patients in Qatar and how their rehabilitation processes affected their functionality. Further research needs to be performed to study and gain an in-depth understanding of how COVID-19 causes stroke and what other factors can determine patients’ potential for improvement.

"Contrastive learning and subtyping of post-COVID-19 lung computed tomography images
","Patients who recovered from the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience a range of long-term symptoms. Since the lung is the most common site of the infection, pulmonary sequelae may present persistently in COVID-19 survivors. To better understand the symptoms associated with impaired lung function in patients with post-COVID-19, we aimed to build a deep learning model which conducts two tasks: to differentiate post-COVID-19 from healthy subjects and to identify post-COVID-19 subtypes, based on the latent representations of lung computed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans of 140 post-COVID-19 subjects and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. A novel contrastive learning model was developed by introducing a lung volume transform to learn latent features of disease phenotypes from CT scans at inspiration and expiration of the same subjects. The model achieved 90% accuracy for the differentiation of the post-COVID-19 subjects from the healthy controls. Two clusters (C1 and C2) with distinct characteristics were identified among the post-COVID-19 subjects. C1 exhibited increased air-trapping caused by small airways disease (4.10%, p = 0.008) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide %predicted (DLCO %predicted, 101.95%, p < 0.001), while C2 had decreased lung volume (4.40L, p < 0.001) and increased ground glass opacity (GGO%, 15.85%, p < 0.001). The contrastive learning model is able to capture the latent features of two post-COVID-19 subtypes characterized by air-trapping due to small airways disease and airway-associated interstitial fibrotic-like patterns, respectively. The discovery of post-COVID-19 subtypes suggests the need for different managements and treatments of long-term sequelae of patients with post-COVID-19.","In this study, we proposed a volume-independent contrastive learning model to differentiate the images of the post-COVID-19 subjects from those of the healthy controls with an accuracy of 0.90 and an AUC of 0.98 on test data, and extract latent representations of the images for discovering subgroups of the post-COVID-19 subjects. Beside the inspiration images, expiration images were used to augment the training images so that the model can be generalized to different lung volumes. This was achieved through a lung volume transform in the training process to maximize the similarity between the inspiration and expiration images. The inclusion of the lung volume transform in the training process ensured the model to capture the features from the inspiration and expiration images of the same subjects. Without use of the lung volume transform, the model became volume dependent. The volume-independence model input feature is essential when precise volume control during scanning cannot be guaranteed.
Three clusters were identified by the latent representations extracted by the contrastive learning model. The first cluster C0 was regarded as the healthy control cluster since it was composed of healthy controls (0% post-COVID-19 subjects), while C1 and C2 clusters were treated as the post-COVID-19 subtypes since they consisted of mostly post-COVID-19 subjects with distinct clinical and imaging features (97.50% and 100.00% post-COVID-19 subjects for C1 and C2, respectively). The characteristics of C1 and C2 were summarized in Table 2.
C1 was dominated by obese female subjects with normal lung functions other than a higher lung diffusing capacity, and most of the C1 subjects were not hospitalized. C1 was characterized by increased lung tissue during inspiration, greater amount of GGO patterns, and thickening bronchovascular structure, which are known phenotypes associated with the inflammation caused by the infection of COVID-19. Another study has suggested that even in mild cases, return of increased GGO can still be observed after 90 days from the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Nagpal et al., 2021). Furthermore, increased air-trapping due to small airways disease (AirT_fSAD% ↑, Tissue_RV % ↓) was found in C1 subjects. It has been shown that small airways disease, which is presented as air-trapping without emphysema, is a long-term sequela of COVID-19 (Cho et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2022). Small airways disease and emphysema are two common progressive phenotypes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The extent of AirT_fSAD% (or emphysema) in C1 subjects is comparable to (or lower than) that of the COPD C1 subjects in former smokers whose severity levels were predominately classified as at risk with GOLD stage 0. Normal DLCO is defined as 75%–140% of predicted (Ponce and Sharma, 2021), so the DLCO % predicted of post-COVID-19 subjects is within the normal range for healthy subjects. The slightly elevated DLCO %predicted in post-COVID-19 subjects was contributed by C1 subjects (101.95%). On the other hand, C2 subjects has decreased and abnormal DLCO %predicted (66.76%). It has been found in a retrospective study that the elevated lung diffusing capacity may related to a clinical diagnosis of obesity and asthma (Saydain et al., 2004). C1 subjects may share similar characteristics with obesity and asthma subjects. It requires more investigation in the future to better understand the elevated DLCO %predicted in C1 subjects.
On the other hand, C2 was dominated by older subjects with impaired lung functions and a more rigid lung (RV/TLC↑, TLC↓), and most of them were hospitalized due to COVID-19. The fact that C2 demonstrated the greatest lung tissue content observed from both expiration and inspiration images and the greatest amount of GGO patterns may show the signs of interstitial fibrotic-like patterns (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, increased bronchovascular thickening (Bronchovascular % ↑) may indicate early bronchiectasis. The hot spots shown in the activation maps demonstrated the features of thickened bronchovascular structures which were observed in C2 (Supplementary Figure S2). It is well established that age and obesity are two of the major risk factors of severe COVID-19 (Zheng et al., 2020; Wolff et al., 2021). Furthermore, it has been reported that severity of COVID-19 is a risk factor of fibrotic-like patterns in post-COVID subjects (McGroder et al., 2021). Thus, C2 may represent the subjects who suffered badly from COVID-19.
This study had several limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small and the cohort came from a single center. There may exist more subgroups of post-COVID-19 subjects due to comorbidities, which would require a larger sample size to be identified. To enhance the generalizability of the clusters, active learning models which learn the multimodal and cross-population data over time would be beneficial (Santosh, 2020; Santosh and Ghosh, 2021). Second, there was no reading for the clusters from radiologists, which may provide more insight to the interpretation of the clusters. In addition, this is a cross-sectional study. The progression of these subtypes requires further investigation.
In this study, we demonstrated that a volume-independent contrastive learning model can differentiate the CT images of post-COVID-19 subjects from those of healthy controls, and it can also extract distinct latent representations from the images for clustering post-COVID-19 subjects. We identified two clinically meaningful subtypes among the post-COVID-19 study cohort. Clusters C1 and C2 are characterized by subjects with air-trapping caused by small airways disease and subjects with airway-associated interstitial fibrotic-like patterns, respectively. It has been reported that contrastive models are able to achieve better performance on unseen data than traditional deep learning models (Chen et al., 2020). With the design of 2D image input, we expect that this pre-trained model can be used for transfer learning on chest X-ray images, which are more accessible at regular clinics, to detect and classify patients with post-COVID-19. Furthermore, with increasing cohort size the model has potential to detect the features caused by different COVID-19 variants. Finally, the knowledge of clinical and imaging features of post-COVID-19 subtypes and the ability of subject classification by the model may facilitate the management and treatment of long COVID.",,,
"Low Vitamin D Levels Are Associated With Long COVID Syndrome in COVID-19 Survivors
","Context
Long COVID is an emerging syndrome affecting 50% to 70% of COVID-19 survivors that still lacks predicting factors.
Objective
Due to the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, we retrospectively assessed the association between 25(OH) vitamin D levels and long COVID in COVID-19 survivors 6 months after hospitalization.
Methods
Long COVID was defined according to NICE guidelines. Fifty long COVID and 50 non–long-COVID subjects matched on a 1:1 basis were enrolled from an outpatient clinic post-COVID cohort seen from August to November 2020. Therapies/comorbidities affecting calcium/vitamin D/bone metabolism, and/or admission to the intensive care unit during hospitalization were exclusion criteria. 25(OH) Vitamin D was measured at hospital admission and 6 months after discharge.
Results
We observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, evaluated at follow-up, in subjects with long COVID than those without (20.1 vs 23.2 ng/mL, P = .03). Regarding the affected health areas evaluated in the entire cohort, we observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels in those with neurocognitive symptoms at follow-up (n = 7) than those without (n = 93) (14.6 vs 20.6 ng/mL, P = .042). In patients presenting vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), both at admission and at follow-up (n = 42), those affected by long COVID (n = 22) presented lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up than those not affected (n = 20) (12.7 vs 15.2 ng/mL, P = .041). In multiple regression analyses, lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up were the only variable significantly associated with long COVID in our cohort (P = .008, OR 1.09, CI 1.01-1.16).
Conclusion
COVID-19 survivors with long COVID have lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than matched patients without long COVID. Our data suggest that vitamin D levels should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. The role of vitamin D supplementation as a preventive strategy of COVID-19 sequelae should be tested in randomized controlled trials.
","In this study we have observed that COVID-19 survivors who reported persistent signs and symptoms 6 months after hospital discharge consistent with long COVID syndrome were characterized by lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than those without the syndrome, and lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels were an independent risk factor for long COVID occurrence.
During the last 3 years, increasing evidence has highlighted the potential role of hypovitaminosis D as a modifiable risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse acute COVID-19 (1). These findings were initially reported by only retrospective and observational studies conducted during the first pandemic wave, and therefore were unable to adequately clarify the possible reverse causality between acute illness and lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, which are known to possibly decrease during the acute inflammatory and immune responses (1). Subsequent prospective and interventional studies conducted with better and rigorous study designs were able to consistently confirm the negative role of low vitamin D in these patients not supporting a central role for reverse causality between COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D observed during the acute illness (1, 7-9, 39). These findings, in addition to the highly reported rates of acute hypocalcemia (40, 41) and skeletal complications (42, 43), have suggested the presence of a distinct and emerging osteo-metabolic COVID-19 phenotype within the endocrine and metabolic comorbidities reported in these patients (44-46). In contrast, the consequences of low vitamin D levels and hypovitaminosis D after the acute phase of COVID-19 are still poorly understood. In fact, COVID-19 survivors are often characterized by the presence of persistent clinically relevant signs and symptoms not explained by other medical conditions and only attributable to the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, markedly impairing their quality of life and postinfection recovery even several months after the acute phase (11-15). So far, different characteristics of patients including gender, concomitant comorbidities, and grade of acute disease severity have been implicated to be possible underlying factors influencing long COVID occurrence risk (14, 15).
Due to the well-known extraskeletal role of vitamin D in regulating immune response and immunocompetence and the consistently reported positive effects on musculoskeletal, neurocognitive, metabolic, and cardiorespiratory health areas, a possible role of vitamin D in recovery of COVID-19 survivors was also hypothesized.
This hypothesis is firstly supported by the observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels reported among 120 not-hospitalized young COVID-19 survivors 3 months after acute disease compared with matched healthy participants. COVID-19 survivors were also characterized by higher inflammatory markers and therefore reverse causality could not be excluded (47). Later studies have subsequently investigated the effect of vitamin D on the risk of the presence of persistent symptoms in these patients, reporting, to date, contrasting results.
Townsend et al investigated the relationship between vitamin D and fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance in a total of 149 patients recruited at a median of 79 days after COVID-19 illness (30). The median vitamin D level was 62 nmol/L (about 24 ng/dL), higher than the levels observed in our cohort in which, differently from the study conducted by Townsend et al, we excluded those with vitamin D supplementation, and fatigue was very common (58%), possibly related to the short-term follow-up visits and to the inclusion in the study also of those who were previously admitted to the ICU. The authors reported no significant relationships between vitamin D status and any of the physical performance outcomes assessed. A later pilot clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle fitness in 30 elderly patients during the recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 infection has reported that treatment with cholecalciferol (2000 IU/day) vs placebo carried out for 6 weeks was associated with a reduction of serum creatine kinase levels and with slight nonsignificant improvements in physical tests (31). An Egyptian cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in post-COVID-19 patients and its relation to persistent symptoms included 219 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the previous 3 months and who were mostly managed at home during the acute clinical course (32). The authors evaluated different symptom categories, including constitutional, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, and gastrointestinal areas, and reported no differences among vitamin D status and these symptoms, although only 16% of the entire cohort presented with not-deficient vitamin D levels. A recent study conducted in an Italian center aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and physical performance including a sample of recovered patients, both hospitalized and not hospitalized, with a mean age of 53 years and re-evaluated in a post-acute outpatient service about 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis (33). Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 35.6% of participants, with a higher prevalence in men than in women, similarly to our data. The authors reported that patients with vitamin D deficiency performed worse on the 6-minute walking test, particularly in those older than 65 years. Finally, in a very recent interventional clinical trial including patients receiving a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo at the time of hospital admission for acute COVID-19 and re-evaluated by telephone interviews at 6 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, no significant differences between vitamin D-treated and placebo groups were observed for the different constitutional and respiratory post-COVID-19 symptoms (34). The authors concluded that the use of vitamin D supplementation was not useful for the management of post-COVID-19 symptoms. In this study, no data regarding 25(OH) vitamin D levels after supplementation was reported, both during hospitalization and during follow-up; moreover, at baseline, both vitamin D–treated and placebo groups presented median vitamin D levels around 21 ng/mL, reducing the potential beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in a population yet to be characterized by a not-deficient vitamin D status (48); finally, the study did not rule out the possibility that intermediate doses of vitamin D administered during follow-up, and not tested, could modify the clinical course of these patients.
The contrasting results reported in these studies can be, at least in part, explained, as already mentioned, by the different inclusion and exclusion criteria of the patients, the different symptoms and outcomes collected, and the different timepoints evaluated after acute disease.
In our study, in order to minimize the possible biases derived from the influence on long COVID occurrence of patient characteristics, such as gender and age, presence of comorbidities, and the different grade of acute disease severity, we aimed to evaluate the role of vitamin D in post-COVID recovery in the presence of a controlled cohort matched 1:1 for long COVID presence/absence, baseline characteristics, and acute disease severity. Moreover, we excluded patients previously admitted to the ICU and those managed at home in order to include a homogeneous population.
In this controlled clinical situation, we observed that patients affected by long COVID syndrome were characterized by lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than those without. No differences were observed regarding vitamin D deficiency prevalence. These data could be related, at least in part, to the adequate vitamin D status observed in part of our cohort mostly characterized by non–older patients with a low prevalence of severe comorbidities and re-evaluated with medium-long term follow-up visits after acute disease.
Furthermore, two-thirds of the patients with low vitamin D levels at hospital admission still presented hypovitaminosis D at the 6-month follow-up. This suggests that reverse causality of COVID-19 on vitamin D levels may occur in some patients but also shows that poor vitamin D status may be intrinsic to several COVID-19 patients (1). In fact, reinforcing the possible negative role of hypovitaminosis D in the recovery of COVID-19 survivors, we also observed that considering only patients presenting vitamin D deficiency both at hospital admission and at follow-up visits, thus excluding those with a possible reverse causality effect of the acute disease on hypovitaminosis D occurrence, long COVID patients were characterized by lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than controls.
Confirming these findings, no differences regarding inflammatory parameters at admission and at follow-up were found between patients with and without long COVID; therefore, these data did not support the influence of disease severity on the differences in 25(OH) vitamin D levels observed in our cohort. Previous studies have hypothesized a possible role of higher inflammation or immunological dysfunction in long COVID risk occurrence (49, 50), particularly in the first months after the acute disease. However, these observations were not confirmed in several later studies evaluating commonly used and available inflammatory biomarkers (51-54). One possible explanation for our findings could be persistent inflammation in patients with long COVID, but not in patients without long COVID, reducing vitamin D binding protein, which in turn could lead to reduced 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Interestingly, we were not able to observe any significant differences in commonly used inflammatory parameters such as CRP, LDH (available only in a part of patients), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio between patients with long COVID and patients with non–long COVID. This may be due to the careful selection of study subjects excluding those with more severe acute COVID-19, such as patients requiring ICU admission and including patients with long COVID and patients without long COVID with comparable acute disease severity. Therefore, it appears unlikely that different degrees of inflammation could explain the differences observed in 25(OH) vitamin D levels.
Interestingly, we observed in our entire cohort lower baseline and follow-up 25(OH) vitamin D levels in patients presenting long-term neurocognitive impairment than those without, possibly also confirming the well-known influence of vitamin D in this specific health area, since interfering data such as differences in seasonality of 25(OH) vitamin D measurements and in demographic and comorbidities data were excluded (25-27, 55). Furthermore, for the first time, to our knowledge, we observed strict negative correlations between baseline and follow-up 25(OH) vitamin D levels and follow-up glucose levels, reinforcing the associations between vitamin D and glucose levels previously reported in patients with acute COVID-19 (5, 56, 57) and the well-known relationships between vitamin D and glycemic status (58-60). Moreover, this finding could represent an additional novel mechanism implicated in long COVID occurrence. The risk of occurrence of this syndrome was reported to be increased in patients with diabetes (14, 61-63), and, since low circulating vitamin D levels have been extensively reported to be associated with poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes and with a higher predisposition of developing impaired fasting glucose and diabetes (64-66), hypovitaminosis D could be, firstly, associated with the increased risk of new developing and incident diabetes after acute COVID-19 (67-71) and, secondly, represent, at least in part, the underlying common pathophysiological factor with a bidirectional negative effect associating diabetes and long COVID occurrence.
Finally, we also confirmed the possible negative role of lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels in long COVID occurrence in multivariate logistic regression as an independent risk factor associated with its development.
Our study has limitations. First of all, the number of enrolled patients was relatively limited due to the use of stringent entry criteria, excluding those with factors possibly affecting vitamin D metabolism and including only those with available data and collected blood samples. Moreover, we included only patients who were previously hospitalized, excluding those who required ICU admission and/or those managed at home only. We accurately performed enrolment in a 1:1 ratio matched for age, sex, comorbidities, and acute disease severity on the basis of long COVID presence/absence. Therefore, the highly controlled nature of the study made it a candidate to recognize at best the possible role of lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels in long COVID occurrence. Secondly, its retrospective nature meant we could not evaluate the direct influence of vitamin D on persistence of symptoms and signs. Thirdly, the monocentric cohort, lack of evaluation of other biologically active forms of serum vitamin D as well as vitamin D binding protein, and a complete immunological profile evaluation at follow-up (inflammatory markers at follow-up were also only available in a subgroup of patients) also limit definitive conclusions. However, although a single center experience cannot definitively assign cause and effect, these evaluations should be considered for future larger studies to clarify the underlying mechanisms on the relationship between vitamin D and long COVID syndrome. Fourthly, we cannot exclude the effects of seasonality on the 25(OH) vitamin D levels observed at admission, evaluated with blood samples collected in spring, and at follow-up visits, evaluated with blood samples collected in autumn. Indeed, the improvement of about 6 ng/mL in 25(OH) vitamin D levels observed between these 2 timepoints in our cohort, including only subjects without vitamin D supplementation, should also be related, in addition to the recovery from the acute disease, to different seasonality measurement. Besides this finding, in our study, the seasonality effects cannot explain the differences observed in 25(OH) vitamin D levels between long COVID and non–long COVID patients, since they were individually selected and matched for the time of follow-up visits, and consequentially evaluated 6 months before in the same time periods of hospital admission.
In conclusion, we have reported that patients with long COVID re-assessed 6 months after hospital discharge are characterized by lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels; lower vitamin D were an independent risk factor for the occurrence of this syndrome. Differently from other previous reports, we observed these findings in a controlled study with a homogeneous population; we did not limit our evaluation during follow-up visits to specific health areas but performed a multidisciplinary evaluation, including the collection of a broad spectrum of symptoms and signs reported by patients with long COVID. Furthermore, the medium-long term follow-up used in our study could probably better identify and characterize patients with post-infection recovery impairment, and thus those who needed more intensive follow-up, possibly requiring preventive and therapeutic strategies, including also vitamin D supplementation. This aspect strongly reinforces the clinical usefulness of 25(OH) vitamin D evaluation as a possible modifiable pathophysiological factor underlying this emerging worldwide critical health issue. Finally, our data if confirmed in large, interventional, randomized controlled trials suggests that vitamin D supplementation could represent a possible preventive strategy in reducing the burden of COVID-19 sequelae.

"Anxiety, Post-COVID-19 Syndrome-Related Depression, and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in COVID-19 Survivors: Cross-sectional Study
","Background
Although the mental health impacts of COVID-19 on the general population have been well studied, studies of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on infected individuals are relatively new. To date, depression, anxiety, and neurological symptoms associated with post–COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) have been observed in the months following COVID-19 recovery. Suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB) have also been preliminarily proposed as sequelae of COVID-19.
Objective
We asked 3 questions. First, do participants reporting a history of COVID-19 diagnosis or a close relative having severe COVID-19 symptoms score higher on depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) or state anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Index) screens than those who do not? Second, do participants reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis score higher on PCS-related PHQ-9 items? Third, do participants reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis or a close relative having severe COVID-19 symptoms score higher in STB before, during, or after the first year of the pandemic?
Methods
This preliminary study analyzed responses to a COVID-19 and mental health questionnaire obtained from a US population sample, whose data were collected between February 2021 and March 2021. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to detect differences in the medians of the total PHQ-9 scores, PHQ-9 component scores, and several STB scores between participants claiming a past clinician diagnosis of COVID-19 and those denying one, as well as between participants claiming severe COVID-19 symptoms in a close relative and those denying them. Where significant differences existed, we created linear regression models to predict the scores based on COVID-19 response as well as demographics to identify potential confounding factors in the Mann-Whitney relationships. Moreover, for STB scores, which corresponded to 5 questions asking about 3 different time intervals (i.e., past 1 year or more, past 1 month to 1 year, and past 1 month), we developed repeated-measures ANOVAs to determine whether scores tended to vary over time.
Results
We found greater total depression (PHQ-9) and state anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Index) scores in those with COVID-19 history than those without (Bonferroni P=.001 and Bonferroni P=.004) despite a similar history of diagnosed depression and anxiety. Greater scores were noted for a subset of depression symptoms (PHQ-9 items) that overlapped with the symptoms of PCS (all Bonferroni Ps<.05). Moreover, we found greater overall STB scores in those with COVID-19 history, equally in time windows preceding, during, and proceeding infection (all Bonferroni Ps<.05).
Conclusions
We confirm previous studies linking depression and anxiety diagnoses to COVID-19 recovery. Moreover, our findings suggest that depression diagnoses associated with COVID-19 history relate to PCS symptoms, and that STB associated with COVID-19 in some cases precede infection.
","Principal Findings
This study produced 4 sets of findings. One set of findings showed an increase in depression and anxiety scores for individuals with COVID-19 infection history compared to those without, and showed this despite a similar incidence of prior history of depression or anxiety in those with and without COVID-19 history. The second set of findings was that the depression-associated symptoms reported by individuals with COVID-19 history included elevated fatigue, problems with concentration, psychomotor retardation or agitation, altered appetite, feelings of guilt, and elevated suicidality. The first 4 of these symptoms overlap significantly with PCS and raise the hypothesis that the experience of PCS and guilt associated with contracting COVID-19 may drive an increase in total depression-associated symptoms and diagnosis. The third set of findings showed that elevated STB scores in individuals with COVID-19 history preceded COVID-19 diagnosis, suggesting the possibility that participants with greater pre-existing STB were more predisposed to contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, time frame analysis indicated that differences in STB before and during the pandemic were more pronounced in those without COVID-19 history, raising the possibility that the experience of COVID-19 had a greater effect on STB in the uninfected population. Finally, the fourth set of findings showed that an increase in depression-associated symptoms in those with family or friends adversely affected by COVID-19 might correlate with an elevation in prior history of depression. Moreover, the increase in depression symptoms was no greater than expected in the general population. In what follows, each of these findings is discussed in greater detail.
This study found that participants reporting a COVID-19 clinician diagnosis (COVID-DIAGNOSIS POS) tended to produce greater cumulative depression (PHQ9-SUM) and state anxiety (STAI-SUM) scores than those denying a diagnosis of COVID-19 (NEG). Of note, the median cumulative depression score for those reporting COVID-19 fell within a range associated with mild depression (13.0), whereas the median score for those denying COVID-19 fell within a range associated with minimal depression (6.0). We found no significant difference in self-reported history of depression (DEPRESSION-HX and DEPRESSION-YRS) or anxiety disorder (ANXIETY-HX or ANXIETY-YRS) between those with and without COVID-19 history, and no evidence for demographic variables confounding the relationships between cumulative depression scores and COVID-19 infection. This suggested that experiencing COVID-19 was the primary driver of participants’ increased depression- and anxiety-associated symptoms at the time of participation. Although the durations between participants’ diagnoses and survey participation times were not precisely known (however, as noted in the Methods, over 95% of participants were expected to have participated in the questionnaire >2 weeks following infection), the specific symptom profiles related to increases in PHQ-9 scores were consistent with PCS, further suggesting that survey participation occurred after primary COVID-19 infection resolution. This agrees with a previous work that observed increased depression and anxiety scores up to 6 months after infection [21-24].
Five specific depression-associated symptom scores were elevated in those reporting COVID-19 history. One might hypothesize that PHQ9-4, which assesses fatigue; PHQ9-7, which assesses difficulty with concentration; and PHQ9-8, which assesses unusually slow or restless behavior, are directly capturing typical PCS symptoms including fatigue and “brain fog” (or concentration loss) [3,4,27]. PHQ9-5 assesses poor appetite and overeating and may capture anosmia and ageusia associated with PCS. PHQ9-6 assesses feelings of guilt, which may capture feelings of guilt associated with the contraction of COVID-19 [31], as well as some participants’ feelings of guilt in spreading COVID-19 to close relatives. PHQ9-9 assesses suicidal ideation and needs to be interpreted in the context of the broader set of STB questions discussed in the next section. Regarding the clinical significance of the 1- or 2-point differences in the PHQ-9 item score medians between the groups, it is important to note that a 1-point increase corresponds to one-third of the entire symptom scoring interval. A movement from 0 to 1, which was frequently observed, corresponds to a shift from the absence of symptoms to symptoms appearing “several days” over the past 2 weeks. These observations were noted in the absence of significant differences between the groups for history of depression or years of depression. Given the significant statistical findings after correction for multiple comparisons, the detected changes in PHQ-9 item scores are likely to be clinically significant. Overall, the current results around specific depression-associated symptoms are consistent with the hypothesis that the experience of PCS and guilt associated with contracting COVID-19 drive an increase in cumulative depression score and a population shift toward a higher frequency of depression diagnosis among people who contract COVID-19.
A caveat of this analysis is that although PCS-associated symptoms may drive depression scores and, in turn, the expected number of depression diagnoses upward, we cannot state whether depression symptoms associated with PCS contribute to an increase in “true” cases of depression. For instance, whether fatigue associated with PCS is pathophysiologically similar enough to fatigue associated with standard depression to produce similar disease courses and treatment responses is unclear. Although this requires further investigation, we believe that depression is already considered a highly heterogenous diagnosis [42,43]. Moreover, evidence suggests that biomarkers of PCS-associated depression align with those already linked to major depressive disorders [44].
Along with the PHQ9-9 question about suicidal ideation, we assessed 5 STB questions over 3 time windows. We observed that the median scores in the COVID-19–positive group were almost universally greater than those in the COVID-19–negative group. Median scores in the COVID-19–positive group largely suggested STB symptoms were experienced “rarely” or “sometimes,” whereas median scores in the COVID-19–negative group suggested STB symptoms were experienced “never.” Given that many of the STB symptoms assessed (in particular, active ideation, suicide planning, and suicide history) are considered abnormal at any frequency, the statistically significant differences detected herein are likely to be clinically relevant. Most of these differences were robust to potential confounders, with the notable exception of scores corresponding to questions about a suicide safety plan (S-SAFETY-LT, S-SAFETY-MT, and S-SAFETY-ST). Importantly, the differences in median scores for questions inquiring about STB more than 12 months ago—prior to the approximate onset time of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and when we expect our participants to have contracted COVID-19—imply that elevated STB scores preceded COVID-19 diagnosis. One possible interpretation is that participants with greater pre-existing STB were more predisposed to contracting COVID-19. This interpretation is consistent with previous work showing that observed STB is associated with a contemporaneous desire for deliberate COVID-19 exposure among the general population [13] and further suggests that elevated STB predating COVID-19 may be associated with actualized contraction of COVID-19. This is also linked to earlier reports that people with increased STB deliberately sought HIV exposure [45-47]. It did not appear that scores for STB questions differed among short-term, midterm, and long-term versions of the same question within those reporting COVID-19 infection, suggesting that the contraction of COVID-19 did not correlate with an increase in suicidality. It should be noted that scores on short-term suicidality questions (inquiring about the past month) remained higher in those reporting COVID-19 infection than in those who did not, which corroborates previous findings that median PHQ9-9 scores were greater in those reporting COVID-19 infection.
This study observed an increase in depression-associated symptoms among those with family or friends adversely affected by COVID-19. Although we found that cumulative depression scores and 3 specific PHQ-9 questions were elevated in these participants (ie, PHQ9-6, PHQ9-8, and PHQ9-9), other analyses suggested that these differences might be explained by depression history variables (eg, DEPRESSION-HX, DEPRESSION-YRS, and COVID-DIAGNOSIS control variables). Thus, no unique relationships could be established between COVID-FAMILY and any other variables studied. Although we are surprised by this finding, we suspect that participants who were emotionally closer to friends or family with COVID-19 were likely to be physically close to them and to be among the 22.3% (23/103) of participants who also became infected with COVID-19. Our results may suggest that people who witnessed more distant relations develop severe or fatal COVID-19 may experience depression, anxiety, and STB at a level equivalent to the portion of the general population that has also been psychologically affected by COVID-19.
Limitations
The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size: 379 participants of whom 39 (10.3%) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis. As a result, our statistical power was limited, and we were unable to substantively consider confounding the main relationships by using categorical demographic variables reflecting ethnicity and employment. In addition, with respect to our target variables, we could not always distinguish between participants infected with COVID-19 and those with family or friends adversely affected by COVID-19. This resulted from a large population overlap, likely reflecting a general tendency for COVID-19 infection to be shared among close friends or family members. Therefore, it may be fundamentally difficult to separate the personal experience of having COVID-19 from experiencing a friend or close family member with it. Relatedly, it is possible that symptoms of grief may present similarly to symptoms of PHQ-9. Although we did not observe increased PHQ-9 scores among participants who experienced COVID-19 among close friends or family members after adjustment for personal COVID-19 status, we note that any PHQ-9 score elevation in this context may have reflected an increase in grief versus depression.
As a questionnaire-based study, our data are subject to forms of response bias, including acquiescence bias (likely leading to inflated PHQ-9, STAI, and STB scores), social desirability bias (likely leading to deflated PHQ-9, STAI, and STB scores, as well as potential inauthenticity about positive COVID-19 status), and extreme responding (likely leading to extreme PHQ-9, STAI, and STB scores). We expect a degree of this bias to be uncorrelated and therefore be mitigated in our core analyses, which involved internal comparisons of participants with respect to COVID-19 status. Although we warn that the existence of these biases suggests that group-wide medians for PHQ-9, STAI, and STB may be elevated, we note that the same phenomenon would be expected when these tools are deployed in a clinical setting—perhaps to an even greater extent because responses directly influence patient medical management and relationships with providers. Most concerningly, we admit the possibility that correlations between the misreporting of depression, anxiety, or COVID-19 history and biased PHQ-9, STAI, and STB responses may exist that compromise the study’s main finding. Although readers should be mindful of this possibility and seek to corroborate this study’s findings with other studies that do not depend on questionnaires, this possibility reflects a universal weakness of questionnaire-based studies and studies done on a big data scale that cannot easily incorporate laboratory-based experiments.
Other limitations include that the survey participants may have been subject to recall bias and specifically have conflated current STB with past STB. Regarding the question order bias, questions pertaining to depression and anxiety history, COVID-19 history, and PHQ-9/STAI/STB were all separated by more than 10 items. In addition, this study would have benefited from collecting the date of COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test and examining the duration of acute symptoms to accommodate a more precise analysis (eg, consideration of PCS symptomology with respect to illness duration and distance from diagnosis). Relatedly, it is possible that 5% of our COVID-19–positive participants may have been actively subject to acute COVID-19 symptoms. Lastly, possession of occupational information about the participants would have brought more depth to the analyses with regard to the targeted COVID-19 health outcomes.
This study examined US survey participants’ current and recent mental health in association with the change in COVID-19 status between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (approximately March 2020) and the time of data collection (early March 2021). In the context of its limitations, it was found that cumulative depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher in those reporting COVID-19 infection despite a similar prior diagnostic history of depression or anxiety in those with and without COVID-19 infection. The majority of depression-associated symptoms overlapped with those reported for PCS, and reports of increased STB commonly preceded the onset of the pandemic. Where there were STB differences across time frames related to times before and during the pandemic, significant differences were only observed in those who had not had COVID-19 infection. Lastly, increases in depression-associated symptoms were observed in those with family or friends adversely affected by COVID-19, which appeared to be related to an increase in prior history of depression in this group. Altogether, these observations argue that the relationship of COVID-19 with depression or anxiety diagnoses and STB is not obvious and will require a more detailed study along with serial longitudinal assessments.

"Characteristics and risk factors for post-COVID-19 breathlessness after hospitalisation for COVID-19
","Background: Persistence of respiratory symptoms, particularly breathlessness, after acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has emerged as a significant clinical problem. We aimed to characterise and identify risk factors for patients with persistent breathlessness following COVID-19 hospitalisation.
Methods: PHOSP-COVID is a multicentre prospective cohort study of UK adults hospitalised for COVID-19. Clinical data were collected during hospitalisation and at a follow-up visit. Breathlessness was measured by a numeric rating scale of 0-10. We defined post-COVID-19 breathlessness as an increase in score of ≥1 compared to the pre-COVID-19 level. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and to develop a prediction model for post-COVID-19 breathlessness.
Results: We included 1226 participants (37% female, median age 59 years, 22% mechanically ventilated). At a median 5 months after discharge, 50% reported post-COVID-19 breathlessness. Risk factors for post-COVID-19 breathlessness were socioeconomic deprivation (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.14-2.44), pre-existing depression/anxiety (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06-2.35), female sex (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00) and admission duration (adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02). Black ethnicity (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.89) and older age groups (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.66) were less likely to report post-COVID-19 breathlessness. Post-COVID-19 breathlessness was associated with worse performance on the shuttle walk test and forced vital capacity, but not with obstructive airflow limitation. The prediction model had fair discrimination (concordance statistic 0.66, 95% CI 0.63-0.69) and good calibration (calibration slope 1.00, 95% CI 0.80-1.21).
Conclusions: Post-COVID-19 breathlessness was commonly reported in this national cohort of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and is likely to be a multifactorial problem with physical and emotional components.
","In this national cohort of 1226 patients who required hospitalisation for COVID-19, half considered their breathlessness to be new or worsening at the research visit compared to before they had COVID-19. Post-COVID-19 breathlessness was associated with the most deprived quintile, pre-existing depression or anxiety, female sex and longer admission duration. Individuals of Black ethnicity and those aged ≥60 years were less likely to report post-COVID-19 breathlessness at follow-up. There was no association between severity of acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 breathlessness. At the research visit, participants reporting post-COVID-19 breathlessness had, on average, worse mental health status, lower haemoglobin levels, and walked shorter distances during and had greater leg fatigue after the ISWT. Individuals with post-COVID-19 breathlessness were more likely to have an FEV1 and FVC below the LLN compared to those with no change or improvement in breathlessness. However, there was no clear association with TLCO or airflow obstruction. Sensitivity analyses supported the primary findings.
Our results have similarities with a French cohort of 478 adults evaluated 3 months after hospitalisation for COVID-19, who found that participants with new or worsening dyspnoea were, on average, younger, and had a longer hospital admission and little or no difference in pulmonary function tests compared to those without new/worsening dyspnoea [18]. In addition, and in keeping with our findings, having a pre-existing respiratory condition was not associated with post-COVID-19 breathlessness [18], which may be explained by individuals with chronic lung disease being used to a background level of breathlessness, which was not considered worse following COVID-19.
In contrast to our study, Jutant et al. [18] found that individuals with new/worsening dyspnoea were more likely to have required ITU treatment and have a pulmonary embolism during the admission. Participants in the study by Jutant et al. [18] had similarities to participants in our cohort, in respect to median age (61 years), sex (58% male) and the proportion who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (9.1%). However, a much greater proportion were intubated (51%), compared to 22% of patients in our study. Prior to COVID-19, Herridge et al. [31] found that patients (median age 44 years, 41% without comorbidities) admitted to the ITU with acute respiratory distress syndrome were likely to have ongoing limitations in exercise capacity due to ventilator-induced lung injury, skeletal muscle wasting and deconditioning. Therefore, it might be anticipated that severity of COVID-19 be associated with post-COVID-19 breathlessness. Our cohort was older and with more comorbidities than the sample studied by Herridge et al. [31] and fewer participants were intubated than the participants reported by Jutant et al. [18]. Therefore, a possible explanation for the lack of association observed between severity of acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 breathlessness in our study may be that those not admitted to the ITU had poor pre-morbid health and were more liable to suffer from acute deconditioning than those admitted to the ITU.
Our analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 breathlessness was not associated with objective measures of airflow obstruction and, therefore, less likely to be a consequence of new airway disease. Similarly, we did not see an excess of restrictive patterns in those with post-COVID-19 breathlessness. Individuals with post-COVID-19 breathlessness had, on average, a lower FVC, which may suggest an element of interstitial disease. In the smaller number of individuals who underwent gas transfer tests, KCO % predicted was lower in those with post-COVID-19 breathlessness compared to those without, but when adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and IMD, the association with post-COVID-19 breathlessness was not statistically significant (i.e. the confidence intervals overlapped with the null value), making the possibility of fibrosis difficult to confirm. We consider it likely that several factors may have contributed to this observation. Firstly, pulmonary vascular involvement (e.g. pulmonary embolism and its sequelae) can contribute to ongoing breathless after acute COVID-19 in the absence of an ongoing clot burden [32]. One possibility is that some individuals with post-COVID-19 breathlessness had subclinical pulmonary emboli during admission [32]. The possible influence of selection bias should also be recognised. Although we aimed to have all patients undertaking all procedures as per protocol, access to more complex lung function tests such as gas transfer was limited and may have resulted in those with clinical features suggesting an interstitial process being more likely to have undergone these tests.
Post-COVID-19 breathlessness was more likely in the most deprived socioeconomic group. Physical activity levels are known to be lowest in the most deprived groups [33], so deprivation may have led to a low exercise tolerance phenotype that was compounded by acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19. Obesity is also associated with deprivation, as well as chronic breathlessness [16, 34]. Whilst obesity was not associated with post-COVID-19 breathlessness, the mean BMI of this sample was 32.0 kg·m−2, which may be an additional contributing factor to the experience of breathlessness. We speculate that post-COVID-19 breathlessness is likely to be a multifactorial and, therefore, heterogeneous problem, which may consist of a decrement in lung function in combination with anxiety or depression, deconditioning, poor exercise tolerance, fatigue and lower haemoglobin. Post-COVID-19 breathlessness may also be influenced by central nervous system perception [35] and whilst we did not collect data specifically to confirm or refute this hypothesis, Jutant et al. [18] found that a greater proportion of individuals reporting new or worsening breathlessness scored highly on the Nijmegen questionnaire [36], suggesting a component of dysfunctional breathing.
Regarding interventions for post-COVID-19 breathlessness, our findings suggest that screening for and addressing both the physical and emotional components of breathlessness are likely to be important. In a randomised controlled trial of a 6-week online breathing and wellbeing programme, Philip et al. [37] demonstrated improvements in mental health and aspects of breathlessness in people with ongoing symptoms after COVID-19. Interestingly, the intervention led to improvements in the affective, rather than the physical component of the Dyspnoea-12 score, which may suggest that changes in breathlessness experience were related to the emotional impact of the wellbeing programme. Other rehabilitation programmes, which have tended to focus on physical conditioning, have also been shown to improve breathlessness [35, 38], walking distance, lower limb strength and health-related quality of life in patients with persisting symptoms after COVID-19 [35, 38, 39], though corroboration of these results in larger trials would be valuable.
PHOSP-COVID is one of the largest cohorts of post-hospitalisation COVID-19 survivors in the world with comprehensive assessment of participants providing information on physical, psychological, and biochemical characteristics and exposures [6, 7]. This analysis included participants discharged between March 2020 and 31 March 2021, meaning patients treated in hospital both before and after changes in clinical practice for COVID-19 patients (e.g. the use of oral steroids [40] or proning during mechanical ventilation [41]) were represented. Limitations include the lack of viral genomic sequencing, vaccination and lung imaging data, which meant that we could not account for vaccination status, radiological abnormalities [18, 19] or the influence that infection with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have on post-COVID-19 breathlessness [42]. Participants in this study represent a small proportion of the total number of patients discharged from hospital after treatment for COVID-19 in the UK, which may affect the generalisability of the results. Furthermore, participants in this study were younger than in another, larger sample of hospitalised COVID-19 patients [43], and only included individuals able to attend the research visit. Predicting the influence of this potential selection bias is challenging, because while more severely affected individuals may be underrepresented, it is conceivable that those with ongoing symptoms may have been more willing to participate.
We chose to use patient-reported breathlessness from the PSQ as the primary outcome because it provided a measure of breathlessness both before and after admission for COVID-19. We wanted to account for pre-existing breathlessness in our analyses because being able to identify participants whose breathlessness was new or worsening after COVID-19 was most important to inform policymakers and health services. We acknowledge that as the PSQ breathlessness score before COVID-19 was recorded at the research visit, patient responses may be considered subjective and liable to recall bias. Nevertheless, as the sensitivity analyses supported the associations identified with the primary outcome, we feel that recall bias or subjectivity related to the PSQ breathlessness score has not unduly influenced the main findings. The model derived in this analysis has the potential to predict the probability that an individual discharged following treatment for COVID-19 will experience post-COVID-19 breathlessness. However, a limitation of our work is the lack of model validation, which should be addressed before the prediction model is used.
The multicentre nature of the study and workload pressures on sites meant the period between discharge and follow-up varied. The heterogeneity introduced by considering patient-reported breathlessness from different periods is likely to influence how individuals reported breathlessness, with those reviewed later since hospital discharge having longer time to recover. Compared to individuals who attended a research visit within 6 months of discharge, a higher proportion of participants attending the research visit ≥6 months after discharge had a longer admission duration and required higher levels of respiratory support. A possible explanation for this observation is that the majority of participants attending 6–8 months after hospitalisation were discharged before July 2020 (supplementary figure S6), and were therefore treated earlier in the pandemic and before the use of oral steroids was widespread [40]. However, overall, there was no difference in the period between discharge and the research visit between those reporting post-COVID-19 breathlessness and those not.
In conclusion, post-COVID-19 breathlessness was common in this national cohort of patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Our analysis indicates that individuals discharged following COVID-19 who are from deprived backgrounds, females, <70 years of age, with pre-existing depression or anxiety and who had an admission of over a week, are at greatest risk of new or worsening breathlessness post-COVID-19.

"Post-COVID dyspnea: prevalence, predictors, and outcomes in a longitudinal, prospective cohort
","Background
The pathophysiology, evolution, and associated outcomes of post-COVID dyspnea remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, severity, and predictors of dyspnea 12 months following hospitalization for COVID-19, and to describe the respiratory, cardiac, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with post-COVID dyspnea.
Methods
We enrolled a prospective cohort of all adult patients admitted to 2 academic hospitals in Vancouver, Canada with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of COVID between March and June 2020. Dyspnea was measured 3, 6, and 12 months after initial symptom onset using the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire.
Results
A total of 76 patients were included. Clinically meaningful dyspnea (baseline score > 10 points) was present in 49% of patients at 3 months and 46% at 12 months following COVID-19. Between 3 and 12 months post-COVID-19, 24% patients had a clinically meaningful worsening in their dyspnea, 49% had no meaningful change, and 28% had a clinically meaningful improvement in their dyspnea. There was worse sleep, mood, quality of life, and frailty in patients with clinically meaningful dyspnea at 12 months post-COVID infection compared to patients without dyspnea. There was no difference in PFT findings, troponin, or BNP comparing patients with and without clinically meaningful dyspnea at 12 months. Severity of dyspnea and depressive symptoms at 3 months predicted severity of dyspnea at 12 months.
Conclusions
Post-COVID dyspnea is common, persistent, and negatively impacts quality of life. Mood abnormalities may play a causative role in post-COVID dyspnea in addition to potential cardiorespiratory abnormalities. Dyspnea and depression at initial follow-up predict longer-term post-COVID dyspnea, emphasizing that standardized dyspnea and mood assessment following COVID-19 may identify patients at high risk of post-COVID dyspnea and facilitating early and effective management.
","This prospective cohort shows that dyspnea is a frequent symptom following COVID-19, and that most patients with dyspnea do not experience a meaningful improvement in the severity of their symptoms in the first year following infection. We also found that dyspnea was associated with worse sleep, mood, quality of life, and frailty in patients at 12 months post-COVID; however, there was no statistically significant difference in pulmonary function comparing dyspneic and non-dyspneic patients post-COVID. The severity of dyspnea and depressive symptoms at 3 months post-COVID were the only predictors of the severity of dyspnea at 12 months post-COVID. Together, these findings highlight the multifaceted nature of post-COVID dyspnea, with many patients having ongoing dyspnea for reasons other than overt pulmonary or cardiac consequences of COVID-19.
Mood may play a role in post-COVID dyspnea and can predict which patients are at risk for significant persistent dyspnea at 12 months. However, it is unclear whether dyspnea itself is driving these mood abnormalities, or whether the mood abnormality is instead contributing to the development of dyspnea. PTSD as a result of being hospitalized with COVID during a global pandemic may also be playing a role, as it is highly prevalent and associated with more persistent physical symptoms post-COVID [24]. There is a trend towards DLCO being reduced in patients with significant dyspnea at 12 months post-COVID, suggesting a possible underlying persistent cardiopulmonary abnormality that may be contributing to the development of dyspnea in some patients. There is also heterogeneity in the dyspneic patients as some have solely reduced DLCO, while others have primarily mood abnormalities or combinations of PFT, cardiac, and mood abnormalities. Our findings emphasize that dyspnea in the post-COVID context is a complex sensory experience that may be influenced by mood in addition to possible underlying cardiopulmonary pathology, and there may be additional factors that are contributing. Previous studies have established decreased peripheral oxygen delivery and abnormal ventilatory response to aerobic activity as mechanisms of post-COVID dyspnea in the absence of cardiopulmonary limitations on invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing [9, 10]. Furthermore, based on our findings, the degree of contribution from these factors and the resulting severity of dyspnea appears to differ from patient to patient.
Post-COVID dyspnea was a persistent problem in our patient cohort, with 49% of patients hospitalized for acute COVID reporting no change in their dyspnea, 24% reporting an increase in their dyspnea, and 20% developing new-onset of clinically meaningful dyspnea at the 12-month mark when compared to 3 months post-COVID. The reason for the increase and new onset of dyspnea at the 12-month mark in a subset of patients is unclear but given the similar PFT findings in dyspneic and non-dyspneic patients, other suggested mechanisms may be implicated including changes in mood, peripheral oxygen delivery, and ventilatory response to aerobic activity over time [9, 10, 24]. Furthermore, the morbidity associated with the dyspnea is also persistent, as evidenced by poorer outcomes in all patient-reported variables in those who had persistent dyspnea at 12 months. Interestingly, the severity of the acute infection does not appear to influence the degree of post-COVID dyspnea, as neither the need for ICU admission or for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher dyspnea scores. Previous studies on long term outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from various etiologies have also demonstrated similar prevalence of dyspnea and mood abnormalities as well as reduced DLCO at 12 months post-ARDS, but the study populations entirely consisted of patients who required mechanical ventilation [25, 26]. We demonstrated similar long-term findings despite 82% of our patients not requiring mechanical ventilation and 51% not requiring ICU admission. This emphasizes the need to use standardized dyspnea and depression assessment tools, rather than traditional indicators like severity of illness or level of oxygen requirements, to identify patients who are at higher risk of post-COVID dyspnea given the multiple determinants of dyspnea beyond the degree of lung injury and resultant pulmonary pathology.
The persistent dyspnea and associated morbidity suggests potential benefit of using a validated dyspnea questionnaire at post-COVID follow-up visits, with similar rationale supporting utility of a standardized mood questionnaire. These can be applied in a variety of settings, including primary care clinics to both identify abnormalities and follow change over time, including potential response to intervention. Dyspnea and mood questionnaires could also be used at the time of discharge from hospital to determine who would benefit from outpatient follow-up and resources. Patients identified to have post-COVID dyspnea may benefit from early referral to supportive counselling and other psychiatric resources given the association of mood abnormalities with dyspnea. As well, dyspneic patients may also benefit from referral to pulmonary rehab, as previous literature demonstrates improvement in dyspnea and mood in the post-COVID patient population [27].
Limitations of our study include the lack of baseline characteristics for the patients prior to the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. We attempted to account for any baseline cardiopulmonary abnormalities by performing a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with known pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease, which yielded consistent findings to the analysis based on all included patients. Another limitation of our study is that newer variants of SARS‑CoV‑2 may result in varying prevalence and severity of post-COVID dyspnea compared to our study cohort compared to the α variant that was responsible for wave 1 infections. Vaccination may also influence the prevalence and severity of post-COVID dyspnea [28, 29], which was not available at the time of initial infection. Thus, our results may not be generalizable to all post-COVID patient populations. Repeating this study in vaccinated and non-hospitalized post-COVID patients would help characterize post-COVID dyspnea in these populations.
In summary, post-COVID dyspnea is common, persistent, and has a significant impact on quality of life. Mood abnormalities may play a role in post-COVID dyspnea in addition to potential cardiorespiratory abnormalities. Dyspnea and depression at initial follow-up predict longer-term post-COVID dyspnea, emphasizing the need for standardized dyspnea and mood assessment following COVID-19 to identify patients at higher risk of post-COVID dyspnea and facilitate early and effective management.

"The Relationship between Post-COVID Syndrome and the Burden of Comorbidities Assessed Using the Charlson Comorbidity Index
","Introduction: The post-COVID-19 syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by the manifestation of signs and symptoms that develop after the acute phase of COVID-19, which persist for a duration of more than 12 weeks and are not explained by any alternative diagnosis. It has been observed that individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, are at a greater risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a useful tool employed to evaluate the burden of comorbidities and predict the prognosis of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. The present study aims to assess whether the burden of comorbidities, evaluated using the CCI, correlates with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Materials and Methods: Between 21 April 2020 and 15 May 2023, we enrolled all consecutive outpatients with previous COVID-19 admissions to a post-acute day-hospital service three months after a negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test. We assessed age, sex, BMI, acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 signs, and symptoms and calculated CCI according to its current definition. Post-COVID-19 syndrome was defined as the persistence of at least one sign or symptom lasting more than 12 weeks after COVID-19 resolution and not explained by an alternative diagnosis. The relationship between post-COVID-19 and CCI was explored first with the chi-squared test, then with different binary logistic regression models. We considered significant values of p lower than 0.05. Results: We obtained a cohort of 3636 patients and observed a significant association between the number of post-COVID-19 symptoms and CCI. Patients developing post-COVID-19 were more commonly affected by a greater burden of comorbidities. Patients with at least one CCI point had an increased risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome (OR:2.961; 95%CI: 2.269–3.863; p < 0.0001), which increased further for CCI ≥ 4 (OR:6.062; 95%CI: 3.163–11.618; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients affected by post-COVID-19 show a greater clinical complexity and a larger burden of comorbidities, synthesized by a higher CCI; moreover, a higher CCI seems to correlate with an increasing post-COVID-19 risk, being the presence of ≥1 or ≥4 CCI points associated with a 3-fold and 6-fold increased risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome, respectively.","In this prospective observational study, we have enlightened a strong correlation between the burden of comorbidities of patients with COVID-19 and the subsequent onset of post-COVID-19 syndrome; indeed, in our cohort, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome were more likely to have comorbidities and, conversely, the presence of comorbidities significantly increased the likelihood of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome.
Previous studies have already shown that COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a significant impact on individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, in particular, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised states, among others [14]. With this study, we aimed to underline the importance of clustering different chronic diseases performed with a score already validated in several acute and chronic settings, such as the CCI. By considering most of the commonly assessed comorbidities, the Charlson Comorbidity Index can more precisely assess the load of chronic disorders at the patient’s level, thus, describing synthetically the clinical complexity of the subject.
The relationship between the burden of comorbidities and COVID-19 is complex and multidimensional. Some comorbidities can weaken the immune response, making it less effective at clearing the virus; individuals with diabetes [15] or autoimmune disorders [16] may have a reduced immune response that makes them more prone to severe COVID-19. On the other side, other disorders are associated with chronic inflammation, and an overactive immune response can trigger a cytokine storm during COVID-19 infection; a disproportionate immune response can cause widespread inflammation and end-organ damage leading to the most severe forms of COVID-19 [17]. In other cases, COVID-19 can also exacerbate the symptoms and complications of pre-existing comorbidities [18]. Therefore, people with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 if they become infected; COVID-19 may lead to more severe respiratory complications, higher rates of hospitalization, and an increased risk of mortality in these populations [19].
Post-COVID-19 is a condition in which individuals experience persistent symptoms or develop new health problems that persist for weeks or months after the acute phase of COVID-19 [1]. The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 has raised concerns about their differential impact on post-COVID-19 symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that these variants may be associated with different phenotypes, which can be attributed to the varying virus–host interactions [20,21]. This could explain the very wide variety of post-COVID-19 symptoms’ clustering observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of these variants on post-COVID-19 clinical phenotype. Some studies suggest that people with specific comorbidities, such as diabetes or autoimmune diseases, may be more likely to develop post-COVID-19 syndrome [22]. Several studies have already shown that frail and comorbid patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are more likely to continue experiencing health problems and adverse outcomes after their initial recovery [13]. Despite a growing body of evidence, the relationship between post-COVID-19 syndrome and the patient’s clinical complexity is still not fully understood and represents an area of ongoing research. A potential direction in this topic is represented by the assessment of the clinical post-COVID-19 phenotype according to the interactions between patients’ characteristics, such as the burden of comorbidities, immune and endothelial function, genetic determinants, and viral genotype.
Preliminary studies have shown that a high CCI correlates with reduced physical performance indices in patients at one-year follow-up after COVID-19. After discharge from the hospital, COVID-19 survivors with higher CCI scores tend to have worse 6 min walk test scores at one-year follow-up, suggesting that a higher CCI score is associated with reduced physical functioning and overall decreased health outcomes in these individuals [23].
In our study, we showed that a higher CCI score, representing a greater clusterization of chronic diseases, appears to correlate with a greater likelihood of post-COVID-19 syndrome. This suggests that individuals with more pre-existing medical conditions may be more likely to experience a wider range of systemic symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19. Even the presence of just one point at CCI is associated with a 3-fold risk increase in post-COVID-19 syndrome; in this sense, a higher age, or the presence of having even an mild, pre-existing medical condition significantly increases the likelihood of experiencing prolonged symptoms and complications after COVID-19 recovery. In addition, further increases in CCI spread the risk of post-COVID-19; in fact, in our study, individuals with a CCI ≥ 4 were six times more likely to develop post-COVID-19 syndrome than those with a lower CCI score.
There are several speculative explanations for the associations found in our study. It is reasonable that individuals with a higher burden of comorbidities, experiencing a more severe acute illness [14], could develop post-COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, comorbidities could exacerbate inflammatory response and immune dysfunction [17], leading to a more prolonged and complicated recovery from COVID-19. Furthermore, several studies have shown that the occurrence of specific metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities can lead to a greater extent of endothelial dysfunction, which is further worsened by the acute COVID-19 infection. It has been found that endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of many of the immediate complications associated with COVID-19, including acute cardiovascular events and thrombosis. Additionally, it is also linked to the onset of various post-COVID-19 signs and symptoms [6,24]. Finally, patients with pre-existing comorbidities may have lower functional organ reserve and, therefore, be more likely to develop post-COVID-19 syndrome. In general, the presence of comorbidities has been already shown to influence the acute and post-acute progression of other pathological conditions [8,25].
Our findings highlight the importance of also considering the subject’s comorbidities and their clusterization when assessing the risk of developing post-COVID-19. The results of our study, if confirmed in other cohorts, suggest that assessing the comorbidity load to evaluate the potential impact on the development of post-COVID-19 syndrome could represent an additional resource for the practicing clinician. Indeed, using the CCI score as a screening tool in patients with COVID-19 can help healthcare professionals identify those who may require more comprehensive care and resources, potentially improving their overall outcomes and their quality of life in the long term. A very high CCI score suggests the presence of a significant burden of comorbidities. Such a clinical complexity could prompt clinicians to take additional precautions, offer specialized care, or closely monitor the patient’s health during the one-year follow-up period after COVID-19 and beyond.
It is important to underline that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex and multilayered condition, and its development and severity have a great inter-individual variation. Further research is needed to understand the exact relationship between post-COVID-19 syndrome and comorbidities.
Study Limitations
The main limitation of this study is related to the typology of patients effectively enrolled and followed-up; older and frail subjects experiencing the most severe forms of COVID-19 could have been lost at the follow-up and could be under-represented in the analyzed cohort. Similarly, younger patients affected by milder forms of COVID-19 could have been over-represented in the population under analysis. Moreover, the creation of a service specifically designed to assess post-COVID-19 sequelae could have increased the number of symptomatic subjects in our cohort for selection bias. The absence of the SARS-CoV-2 genotype did not allow us to describe the phenotype of the post-COVID-19 syndrome according to this characteristic. Some symptoms, such as fatigue, are very vague and common and could have contributed to an overdiagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome. However, several cohort studies estimate the prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome between 35 and 85%, depending on the severity of the acute phase of the disease [26]. Of note, since a very wide variety of signs or symptoms has been described as a part of the post-COVID-19, it is very difficult to extensively analyze all the components of this heterogeneous clinical entity and to exactly assess its real prevalence according to its current definition. However, by analyzing the most frequently described manifestations of post-COVID-19, we were able to obtain a good estimate of the prevalence of each symptom. Last, albeit common, we did not retrieve any information regarding the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and acute vascular events after the acute phase of the infection, focusing mainly on the development of subacute signs and symptoms.

"Predictors of the post-COVID condition following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection
","Whereas the nature of the post-COVID condition following mild acute COVID-19 is increasingly well described in the literature, knowledge of its risk factors, and whether it can be predicted, remains limited. This study, conducted in Norway, uses individual-level register data from 214,667 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals covering a range of demographic, socioeconomic factors, as well as cause-specific healthcare utilization in the years prior to infection to assess the risk of post-COVID complaints ≥3 months after testing positive. We find that the risk of post-COVID was higher among individuals who prior to infection had been diagnosed with psychological (OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.84–2.44), respiratory (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.78–2.32), or general and unspecified health problems (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.52–2.09). To assess the predictability of post-COVID after mild initial disease, we use machine learning methods and find that pre-infection characteristics, combined with information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus type and vaccine status, to a considerable extent (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI 0.75–0.81) could predict the occurrence of post-COVID complaints in our sample.","In this observational study of ~214,000 individuals with confirmed COVID-19, we found that pre-pandemic health care utilization related to psychological, respiratory, and general/unspecified health problems were the strongest predictors for having a doctor-diagnosed post-COVID condition between 90 and 180 days after the initial infection. We also found that women, and individuals infected by the original (first) virus variant, had a higher risk of post-COVID complaints. There was no strong or clear social gradient in the prevalence of the post-covid. Last, we found that when accounting for virus type, vaccination was not significantly associated with the post-COVID condition.
Comparison to previous studies
This study found a 0.42% incidence of post-COVID complaints among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 between July 1st 2020 and January 24th 2022. This is low compared to several previous survey-based studies, which sometimes report an incidence above 10%. However, it aligns well with a recent study from the UK utilizing electronic health records from primary care which found a prevalence of 0.4%6. Such large differences in incidence likely reflects that post-COVID cases identified using health care utilization data could be considered as more severe than those measured in surveys. In summary, the incidence of post-COVID complaints varies considerably depending on measurement methods7.
The higher incidence among women and middle-aged (i.e., declining at higher ages) found in our study has also been observed in several other studies6,12,22. We found indications of a U-shaped association between income and the post-COVID condition, i.e., that individuals with middle income (40th to 80th percentile) has higher odds for having the post-COVID condition than other individuals. Moreover, individuals with low university education had a higher odds of the post-COVID condition when compared to individuals with other education levels. These findings of socioeconomic gradient are partly contradictory to findings reported in other studies6,21. It should be noted, however, that the absolute differences in resources between the top and bottom of socioeconomic distributions differ significantly between countries, making cross-country comparisons difficult to interpret.
To our knowledge, the increased risk of post-COVID complaints following infection by the original virus variant, compared to the other virus types has not been shown before; while the lack of protective effect of vaccines (Fig. 1, panel b) is in line with previous studies suggesting no, or only partial protection23–25.
Regarding pre-pandemic healthcare utilization, the increased risk among individuals with respiratory health problems or adverse prior mental health is comparable to what was found in recent studies6,12,21. The repeated finding of a positive association between post-COVID complaints and poor mental health in our and previous studies raises important and difficult questions related to underlying mechanisms. We suggest these associations as topics for future studies20. The increased risk among individuals with general and unspecified health problems has, to our knowledge, not been shown in primary healthcare data. This heightened risk could reflect individual differences in help-seeking when experiencing health problems after a COVID-19 disease.
The prediction performance from the machine learning models reflects that pre-infection data is informative about the likelihood of post-COVID. For comparison, a recent study based on data collection through an app (The COVID Symptom Study), showed an AUC = 0.7612. However, contrary to our study, this study used the post-infection measures—number of symptoms reported within the first week—as predictors, and duration beyond 28 days as a post-COVID case. It also worth noting that in our case two models with very different degrees of complexity had similar AUCs, suggesting that a simple (linear model) and sparse (few explanatory variables) model would perform almost equally well.
Interpretation and relevance
We found that a limited set of predictors provided substantial information regarding the risk of post-COVID complaints. To illustrate, while the average risk in our sample was 0.42%, the risk among those with the strongest risk factors was 10-fold (~4%; original virus, female, prior history (2017–2019) of respiratory, psychological and general health problems). These findings imply that a simple checklist of yes/no questions may function as a prognostic tool for predicting post-COVID health complaints. As such, we believe our study has important implications for care providers, for example in general practitioner settings and/or in specialist care settings. When our findings are validated in other samples and populations, a checklist of yes/no question as described above can be implemented into clinical practice to provide information about a patient’s prognosis following COVID-19. Such knowledge may be important for timely treatment decisions and/or for prevention of long-term sickleave (at least when the same doctor is following the same patient over time and when the same doctor is responsible for prescribing sick leave). The checklist may further provide important knowledge for rehabilitation personnel. For example, when a patient has undergone COVID-19 and receives physiotherapy in the recovery period, the interventions could be better targeted to the individual based on the knowledge that the individual is at no risk or at enlarged risk of the post-covid condition. Last, when validated out of sample, we believe our checklist may also be used in the selection of individuals to future trials or observational studies. However, it should be noted that not everyone with a positive test will visit primary care with complaints, and treatment options are currently limited. We have previously reported that the prevalence of common medical complaints and health care visits following COVID-19 is elevated particularly 1–3 months after positive test26,27. A small proportion of the individuals visiting primary care during 1–3 months post COVID will still need care at 4–6 months, however it is unclear what care would be helpful for this group of individuals. As such, the proposed checklist may be useful among individuals testing positive who are symptomatic, i.e., individuals visiting their doctor with complaints in the acute and/or sub-acute COVID-19 phase, when more treatment options are available. We believe this potential clinical usefulness of our findings as well as timely treatment options should be further investigated in future studies.
Strengths and weaknesses
The main strength of the study is that it covers close to all infected individuals in Norway during the study period, as well as complete registrations of their health care utilization in the years prior to the pandemic. Hence, the study to a very limited degree suffers from sample selection or recall bias. Moreover, healthcare utilization and socioeconomic characteristics were measured prior to the pandemic, hence there is no risk of reverse causation.
The study has several limitations. Our main limitation is that the outcome measure was constructed based on health care utilization. There could be considerable heterogeneities across the population with regards to the propensity to seek help. Hence, the prevalence measured along any given dimension—e.g., age, sex or socioeconomic background—could entail considerable bias, to the extent that these dimensions correlate with health-seeking behavior. For example, the higher prevalence found among women and middle-aged could potentially be explained by a higher inclination to seek professional help for health problems in these groups.
Another potential limitation of our study is the risk of misclassification related to whether general practitioners accurately reported positive COVID-19 tests to the official register. Although general practitioners were required by law to report all cases of COVID-19 to the official register, there could exist cases where infections were not reported, potentially resulting in false post-COVID classification (i.e., the post-covid condition as reported in our study could be due to a second episode of COVID-19). However, we consider this risk limited, as measures were put in place to remind general practitioners of the immense importance of continuously reporting cases during a national health crisis. Further, reinfection was rare: ~2% of those infected in between July 2020 and Aug 2022 were infected twice within 180 days (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Lastly, the post-COVID condition was a new phenomenon in the early phases of the pandemic and general practitioners may not have known how to interpret, or code, the symptoms reported by their patients. Although it was possible to register an R992 code together with a persistent complaint, the primary care physicians might not have done so. The operationalization chosen in this study is in line with the official guide given to general practitioners in April 2021 and in accordance with the WHO definition of the post-COVID condition. We found similar results in our sensitivity analysis where inclusion was started in January 2021, with corresponding potential post-COVID cases from April 2021 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Still, there may be individual variations in coding practices, which might have influenced results.
Moreover, patient groups prefer self-diagnosis as a definition, and we believe our findings need to be replicated and/or nuanced in future studies using patient-reported outcome measures. Along this line, there may be important post-covid complaints not studied here. For example, loss of taste and smell are commonly reported among patients1,28 but could not be studied here because of low numbers.
In conclusion, we found that individuals with mild initial COVID-19 and a prior history of psychological, respiratory, or unspecified/general health problems, had a higher risk of developing post-COVID complaints. There was also an increased risk among women and those infected by the Wuhan-virus. When validated in other samples and settings, these findings may be used by clinicians and care providers to inform about the prognosis after COVID-19 regarding the development of the post-covid condition.

"Validation of the Post-Covid-19 Functional Status Scale into Mexican-Spanish
","Aim
To translate and validate the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale into Mexican-Spanish.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was performed for transcultural validation of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale in people over 18 years of age, using the international guidelines for validation published by Beaton and Guillemin. Diagnostic and clinimetric validity tests were applied to the scale. Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical program R.
Results
The scale was applied to 249 patients, obtaining a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84 for the structured interview, and 0.67 for the self-reported questionnaire. When comparing both tests, and considering the structured interview as the reference test, the self-reported questionnaire had a sensitivity of 86.2%, a specificity of 96.3%, and a negative predictive value of 95.8%.
Conclusion
A practical and valid scale was obtained, in concordance with that published in the original version, which can be used in daily clinical practice and rehabilitation. The scale can be used to rapidly and adequately identify post-COVID-19 patients with alterations in functionality who could benefit from rehabilitation therapy.

","The study population comprised 249 people diagnosed with COVID-19; 140 (56.2%) women and 109 (43.8%) men, age range 19–83 years, mean age (standard deviation (SD) 45 years (SD 14.2, with no significant differences between women and men (χ2 = 8.2699, p > 0.05). The detected functional grade on the post-COVID-19 functional scale was: grade 0 = 16.4% (n = 41), grade 1 = 25.7% (n = 64), grade 2=34.5% (n = 86), grade 3 = 19.7% (n = 49) and grade 4 = 3.6% (n = 9).
The transcultural validation process was carried out based on the international guidelines published by Beaton (5) and Guillemin (6), obtaining a construct and criterion validity, which absorbs the test from the original version, as well as a discriminant validity by carrying out a preand post-COVID-19 comparison, which measures the consequences of the disease over time, and the sensitivity to change, by performing measurements at discharge, at 4 and 8 weeks, and at 6 months after discharge. A Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84 was obtained in the structured interview, with a covariance between items of 0.0469. The self-reported questionnaire obtained a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.67, with a covariance of 0.0537. When comparing the PCFS Scale structured interview version with the 12- item WHODAS 2.0 instrument a correlation coefficient of 0.83 was obtained, which indicates that this provides an adequate measurement of the degree of post-COVID-19 functionality.
Comparison of the 2 versions of the adapted PCFS Scale, using the structured interview as the reference test, found a prevalence of 23% of patients with significant functional limitation post-COVID-19, the self-reported questionnaire having a sensitivity of 86.2%, specificity of 96.3%, and negative predictive value of 95.8%. Hence, the instrument provides a screening test with good validity, since it eliminates patients with no functional limitation, and the test is stable for use in screening the patient population for those who require rehabilitation. The psychometric, and validation tests indicate that the Mexican-Spanish version of the scale is reliable and accurate, and it can thus be used routinely by health personnel as a screening test to determine the degree of post-COVID-19 functionality. Details of the translation and cultural adaptation of the scale are shown in Table I.
The structured interview enabled us to observe which symptoms patients presented when applying the scale, and found that fatigue, pain (in any location), headache, dyspnoea, cough and anxiety, are the most frequent post-COVID-19 symptoms; while, headache, cough, muscle weakness, pain (in any location), odynophagia and rhinitis were the most frequent symptoms in the acute phase of COVID-19 (see Fig. 1).These results are in concordance with those published for the original version of the PCFS Scale by Klok et al. (3); hence this is a valid instrument, with a similar Cronbach’s alpha, which determines its utility in clinical practice and research. An adequate validation process was performed, obtaining the criterion validity as well as the construct of the original version. In addition, the scale was compared with WHODAS 2.0, in order to obtain an adequate instrument for reference, since it measures quality of life. In addition the study determined the sensitivity and specificity of the PCFS Scale, which has not been described previously for this instrument.
Rehabilitation programmes help to treat symptoms, such as dyspnoea and anxiety, and to reduce complications, minimize disability, preserve function and improve quality of life. The PCFS Scale self-reported version provides a supportive tool for use alongside the standard instruments already in use in cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation services to treat post-hospitalized patients (10). It can be used as a screening test, to identify patients who require assessment by the rehabilitation and cardiology specialties. The PCFS Scale structured interview version can be used to catalogue the patient with greater sensitivity and to determine the optimum treatment to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including the functional repercussions.
The Stanford Hall consensus (11) for post-COVID- 19 rehabilitation, makes several recommendations based on the best available evidence regarding rehabilitation in post-COVID-19 care, including general precautions and procedures regarding mitigation of contagion among the health personnel providing care. The availability of an instrument such as the PCFS Scale indirectly enables measurement of the patients’ degree of functionality, through a self-reported questionnaire, which provides extra support for clinical practice in primary healthcare, by streamlining assessments and reducing the time spent on medical practice.

"Determinants of post-COVID-19 symptoms among adults aged 55 or above with chronic conditions in primary care: data from a prospective cohort in Hong Kong
","Background
Primary care patients, especially those with an older age, are one of the most vulnerable populations for post-COVID-19 symptoms. Identifying predictors of post-COVID symptoms can help identify high-risk individuals for preventive care.
Methods
Out of 977 primary care patients aged 55 years or above with comorbid physical and psychosocial conditions in a prospective cohort in Hong Kong, 207 patients infected in the previous 5–24 weeks were included. The three most common post-COVID-19 symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive difficulty), which lasted beyond the 4-week acute infection period, were assessed using items from the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS), together with other self-reported symptoms. Multivariable analyses were conducted to identify predictors of post-acute and long COVID-19 symptoms (5–24 weeks after infection).
Results
The 207 participants had a mean age of 70.8 ± 5.7 years, 76.3% were female, and 78.7% had ≥2 chronic conditions. In total, 81.2% reported at least one post-COVID symptom (mean: 1.9 ± 1.3); 60.9, 56.5 and 30.0% reported fatigue, cognitive difficulty, and breathlessness respectively; 46.1% reported at least one other new symptom (such as other respiratory-related symptoms (14.0%), insomnia or poor sleep quality (14.0%), and ear/nose/throat symptoms (e.g., sore throat) (10.1%), etc.). Depression predicted post-COVID-19 fatigue. The female sex predicted cognitive difficulty. Receiving fewer vaccine doses (2 doses vs. 3 doses) was associated with breathlessness. Anxiety predicted a higher overall symptom severity level of the three common symptoms.
Conclusion
Depression, the female sex, and fewer vaccine doses predicted post-COVID symptoms. Promoting vaccination and providing intervention to those at high-risk for post-COVID symptoms are warranted.
","4.1. Summary
One in five older primary care patients in this prospective cohort was infected during the 5th wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. A total of 80% of patients with comorbid physical and psychosocial conditions suffered from post-COVID symptoms: about 60% had fatigue (predicted by depression), 60% had cognitive difficulties (predicted by the female sex), and 30% had breathlessness (predicted by two doses, but not 0 or 1 dose, in reference to three vaccine doses) in the multivariable regression models. Baseline anxiety predicted overall post-COVID symptom severity. In addition, frailty predicted fatigue and cognitive difficulty among those with multimorbidity after infection.
4.2. Strengths and limitations
The strength was that this was a prospective longitudinal study that examined various demographic, behavioural, physical, social and psychological predictors of post-COVID symptoms among old primary care patients with comorbid conditions. Risk factors for the three most common post-COVID-19 symptoms were examined. The study had several limitations. First, it might have a selection bias as participation was voluntary. The study only included those patients with complete data at both time points, though multiple calls were made to reach them. The results may not reflect all older patients in primary care, though we believe the rates of infection and symptoms could be higher as usually those who do not respond are those with more severe conditions (35). Second, the sample size may be insufficient for some subgroups and for identifying some potential risk factors (e.g., very few participants received 0 or 1 vaccine dose, or were underweight). But the sample size should be adequate for most risk factors. Future studies with a larger sample size are important to validate our findings. Third, only the three most common post-COVID-19 symptoms were asked using a validated measure, and other post symptoms were self-reported by open question. We might have under-reported some symptoms, though the rate was similar to the rate (76%) reported in another local study of 106 hospital-admitted patients (36, 37).
4.3. Comparison with existing literature
The infection rate found in this cohort was higher than the rate (10%) of the general population in Hong Kong in early May 2022 (38). This further implies older primary care patients with comorbid physical and psychosocial conditions as a vulnerable population for COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms was similar to the above local study (36) and twice the global prevalence in a recent meta-analysis: 43% (95% CI: 39–0.46%) (7). Although we only found 3 doses of vaccines had higher protection on post-COVID-19 symptoms compared to 2 doses, but not 0 or 1 dose, this might be due to fewer participants having 0 or 1 dose in the study. Recent population studies showed that 3 doses (mRNA vaccines or a combination of an mRNA vaccine and an inactivated vaccine) provided the best protection against COVID-19 severity (39–41). A recent retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database with 486,149 adults found age, female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities (depression, anxiety, migraine, etc.) were risk factors for long COVID (37). The difference might be due to that we had a different study setting and population, adjusted many other various variables as well (e.g., frailty, sarcopenia, physical activity level), and had a smaller sample size. Further studies would be still needed to take a closer look at these risk factors. A study among 54,960 participants in a nurse cohort (predominantly females) in the United States also found that probable depression, probable anxiety, worry about COVID-19, perceived stress, and loneliness early in the pandemic before SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with a higher risk for post-COVID-19 conditions [risk ratio (RR) ranged 1.32–1.47] (42). The potential reasons for this association might be that those with psychological distress have more chronic proinflammatory cytokines or low-grade microglia activation (42). Regarding gender differences, a recent review showed that the likelihood of having long COVID syndrome was significantly greater among females (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.13–1.32) in general, including diseases of Ear, Nose, or Throat (ENT), gastrointestinal (GI), psychiatric/mood, neurological, dermatological, and other conditions, while the likelihood of endocrine and renal disorders was significantly greater among males (43). The review suggested that differences in the immune system might explain the sex differences. More rapid and robust immune responses with stronger IgG antibody production were seen in the early stages of SARS-COV-2 infection in women, protecting them from infection and severity. However, this might also result in prolonged autoimmune-related disease (43–45). In addition, it is also likely that women are generally more attentive to their body and related distress (46). Overall, there are still many unknowns regarding why depression and sex may predict post-COVID-19 symptoms.
4.4. Implications for research and/or practice
First, comparing to two doses, having 3 doses of vaccination was at a lower risk of post-COVID-19 symptoms. However, we did not see a difference of 3 doses comparing to 0 or 1 dose. This may need a further close look of the protective effect of vaccination among this population. Second, to identify at-risk populations with post-COVID-19 symptoms in primary care among older adults with comorbid physical and psychosocial conditions, attention should be paid to those with pre-existing depressive and anxiety symptoms. Future studies are needed to understand the potential mechanisms of these associations for effective intervention design. Studies with evidence-based interventions such as physical exercise, for reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms (modifiable risk factors) may be studied and incorporated into primary healthcare to prevent future outbreaks. In addition, it might need more attention to the sex differences in post-COVID-19 symptoms, its relevant mechanisms, and subsequent interventions. Finally, special attention should be paid to post-COVID symptom severity among frail older adults.
In conclusion, depression, the female sex, frailty and fewer vaccine doses predicted post-COVID-19 symptoms. Future studies should be conducted to explore the potential mechanisms. Promoting vaccination and providing intervention to those at high-risk for post-COVID symptoms are warranted.
